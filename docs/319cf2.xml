            <title>there are some great parts about the AI EO, but as the govt implements it, it will be important not to slow down innovation by smaller companies/research teams.

i am pro-regulation on frontier systems, which is what openai has been calling for, and against regulatory capture.</title>

            <title>this is interesting, and i think close to what the majority of voters actually want:

a reasonable, centrist candidate running on 1) a message of a strong economy and increasing affordability 2) a focus on safety and 3) generational change.

curious to see what happens.</title>

            <title>R to @sama: maybe most importantly, he will offer unwavering support on bad days.

he does this quietly in the background and never asks for anything other than learning about AI.

most companies have someone like this in their history, but they never get enough credit. thank you, brian.</title>

            <title>i wish the world were studying solar geoengineering more.

clearly have misgivings about it, but it's so relatively cheap that i think some country is just going to do it if/when the climate crisis gets bad enough as a temporary patch.

would be great to learn more before then.</title>
