            <title>R to @sama: i am slowly making peace with being a public figure, which can be painful. i assume it will get more intense as our systems become much powerful and that's ok.

on the positive side, i have learned a lot this year.</title>

            <title>R to @sama: we have renewed focus on our mission to build safe AI that empowers people; we'll have remarkable progress to share in 2024.

i've never felt better about our research/product plans, and i look forward to us focusing more on what governance for this technology might look like.</title>

            <title>it’s been a crazy year.

i’m grateful that we put a tool out in the world that people really love and get so much benefit from.

more than that, i am glad that 2023 was the year the world started taking AI seriously.</title>

            <title>for a long time i said that antisemitism, particularly on the american left, was not as bad as people claimed.

i'd like to just state that i was totally wrong.

i still don't understand it, really. or know what to do about it.

but it is so fucked.</title>

            <title>R to @sama: The best interests of the company and the mission always come first. It is clear that there were real misunderstandings between me and members of the board. For my part, it is incredibly important to learn from this experience and apply those learnings as we move forward as a company. I welcome the board’s independent review of all recent events. I am thankful to Helen and Tasha for their contributions to the strength of OpenAI.</title>
