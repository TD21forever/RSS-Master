It accelerates prompt engineering through an SDK that allows implementing complex prompting techniques and gives rich analytics that visualize the network's outputs.<br /> - PromptIDE was originally created to accelerate development of Grok and it has helped xAI iterate quickly over different prompts and prompting techniques.<br /> - It is currently available to members of Grok early access program.</li> <li><strong>Amazon is developing a model codenamed Olympus to rival OpenAI</strong><br /> - Amazon is investing millions in training an ambitious LLM, hoping it could rival top models from OpenAI and Alphabet. The model, codenamed “Olympus”, has 2 trillion parameters, making it one of the largest models being trained. (OpenAI's GPT-4 is reported to have one trillion parameters.) However, there is no specific timeline for releasing the new model.</li> <li><strong>MySpace co-founders unveil text-to-video AI that uses your selfie to personalize content</strong><br /> - The social-media product uses AI to turn text into videos. PlaiDay creates three-second clips for free after a few prompts. But here is the notable feature– add your photo to make it look like you. It uses your selfies to personalize the video, which you can then share with friends and followers. The video duration will expand in the future, and the company is also working on adding an audio capability.</li> <li><strong>Google is rolling out new generative AI tools for advertisers</strong><br /> - They will create ads, from writing the headlines and descriptions that appear along with searches to creating and editing accompanying images. It is for both advertising agencies and businesses without in-house creative staff. Google also guarantees it won't create identical images, so competing businesses have no same photo elements.</li> <li><strong>IBM launches a $500 million enterprise AI venture fund</strong><br /> - It will invest in a range of AI companies– from early-stage to hyper-growth startups– focused on accelerating generative AI technology and research for the enterprise. IBM will be the sole investor of the fund.</li> <li><strong>Figma introduces FigJam AI to spare designers from boring planning prep</strong><br /> - The idea is that FigJam AI can reduce the preparation time needed to manually create collaborative whiteboard projects from scratch, leaving designers with time for more pressing tasks. It is currently available in open beta and is free for all customer tiers.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft partners with VCs to give select startups free AI chip access</strong><br /> - It is updating its startup program, Microsoft for Startups Founders Hub, to include a no-cost Azure AI infrastructure option for “high-end,” Nvidia-based GPU virtual machine clusters to train and run generative models, including ChatGPT-style LLMs.<br /> - Y Combinator and its community of startup founders will be the first to gain access to the clusters in private preview.</li> <li><strong>AI just negotiated a contract for the first time ever– no humans involved.</strong><br /> At Luminance’s London headquarters, the company demonstrated its AI, called Autopilot, negotiating a non-disclosure agreement in a matter of minutes without any human involvement. It is based on the firm’s own proprietary LLM to automatically analyze and make changes to contracts.</li> <li><strong>Mozilla is testing an AI chatbot to help you shop</strong><br /> - It will answer questions about products you’re considering buying. Fakespot Chat is Mozilla’s first LLM and can respond to questions on a product’s “quality, customer feedback, and return policy.”</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/xai-promptide-and-amazons-model-to-rival-openai">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17qqksi/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11082023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17qqksi/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_11082023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hey guys, I have a project in mind. Let's start with the ultimate goal: to create an autonomous society of independently thinking AI agents. In other words, to <strong>replicate humanity with AI</strong>. </p> <p>You can read about the closest thing done so far to what i have in mind <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/04/surprising-things-happen-when-you-put-25-ai-agents-together-in-an-rpg-town/">here</a>. </p> <p>A bit on my background first: I'm an tech entrepreneur in the physical products space. Over the past few years, i have raised $11m for my company, which is now profitable and growing. I am very excited about the many opportunities that AI brings, and want to build something truly impactful with it. However, i have limited technical knowledge in this space. </p> <p>Now, onto the project. I foresee the main issue being the computational cost for the time being. I am willing to invest in such cost, but the target is to keep it alive from day one, and expand it as we can afford to. So, we will have to go in stages. </p> <p><strong>Stage 1: the AI reality show</strong><br /> The first step would be to build something simple and get enough traction to cover our comp cost. This is what i envision: <strong>two AI agents, a man and a woman, live in a simulated house</strong>. Anyone on the internet can access a URL to see what they are doing (and what they are thinking) at any time. We will develop each personality <em>a priori,</em> as detailed as possible, and then let them live their lives autonomously. This has to be visual as well, so we will need a game developer to design realistic agents and environment. It will be like watching a reality show but with the ability of knowing the thoughts of the agents as well. </p> <p>At this stage, we will already have significant traction, and we will build a community of &quot;watchers&quot;. In order to make it more engaging, watchers should have the option of influencing what happens. To do so, every day the community will propose and vote on &quot;messages&quot; that we can send to the agents. The agents will pray once a day, and at that time the daily message will come to them in the form of an answer from what they think is their god. The family can grow, as the two agents can decide to have children. </p> <p>By now, we will be able to get the first investments (i'll take care of this), to get to stage 2. </p> <p><strong>Stage 2: the personal AI family</strong> </p> <p>At this point we already have (1) a public and (2) funds. We will now give the option to whoever is willing to pay a monthly fee to <strong>create their own personal AI family</strong>, built in the same way as the reality show. This time, they can interact directly with them once a day to guide their lives, without having to propose or vote on messages. Sort of like a guardian angel. </p> <p>By now, we also have some revenue coming in, and we can raise more funds. </p> <p><strong>Stage 3: the AI humanity</strong> </p> <p>The final stage will see the environment change: from isolated houses for each AI family, we will build <strong>a large environment, where all the agents can interact with each other</strong>. A world. At this point every agent will have developed a complex personality, and will autonomously interact with all the other agents in the world, with the only outside interaction being with their &quot;guardian angel&quot;. Anyone who wants to participate, can pay a monthly fee to introduce a new agent to the world. If agents make children, the child's guardian angel will be that of the parents, unless he/she wants to assign the guardian angel rights to somebody else. </p> <p>By now, this will be a worldwide known project. Anyone will be able to watch it and see how it develops, but only the guardian angels will have the ability of reading the thoughts and influencing their agents. Additional investments, if needed, will be very easy to get.</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p><strong>Advantages for (real) humanity of having such a world:</strong><br /> - <strong>Social and behavioral research</strong>: It's like a lab for social scientists to watch how society ticks. They can see how personalities shape up and what happens when different characters mix, without any real-world mess.<br /> - <strong>Ethical and philosophical exploration</strong>: It's a chance to play out the &quot;what-ifs&quot; of ethical dilemmas without real-world consequences. Think of it as a video game where we learn about right and wrong on a societal level.<br /> - <strong>AI development and ethics</strong>: Continuous observation and interaction with the AI humanity would provide real-time feedback on AI behavior, contributing to the development of ethical AI governance frameworks and standards for responsible AI usage.<br /> - <strong>Predictive modeling and simulation</strong>: By observing the interactions of AI agents with complex personalities, data analysts and modelers could improve predictive models related to human behavior. This could be particularly useful in urban planning, policy-making, and economic forecasts. </p> <p><strong>Most difficult challenges that i expect:</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Tech</strong>: We'd need a boatload of computing power and some serious AI smarts to make this work. It's like building a video game that's running a million things at once. Hopefully by the time we get to stage 3 we will already have developed all that's needed.<br /> - <strong>Money</strong>: This won't be cheap. We'd need a lot of cash to get it off the ground and keep it flying. Hopefully the different stages will help with this.<br /> - <strong>Personalities</strong>: Crafting AI that's convincing enough to pass for human, with all our quirks and unpredictability, is not going to be easy. We will need someone with a psychology background in the team.<br /> - <strong>Ethics</strong>: Playing god with a digital society could lead to a bunch of ethical headaches. We've got to tread carefully to avoid creating a Black Mirror episode. </p> <p><strong>To make it work, this is the team that we will need, so if you are among these and you are excited to build this, please DM me:</strong><br /> - <strong>AI Devs</strong>: You'll tackle the core AI programming. Expect to work on complex behavior models and decision-making algorithms.<br /> - <strong>Game Designers</strong>: Your role is to create the virtual environment and character designs, ensuring a smooth and engaging user interface.<br /> - <strong>UX/UI Designers</strong>: We need practical design solutions for user interfaces, focusing on ease of use and clear presentation of the AI's thoughts and actions.<br /> - <strong>Data Analysts</strong>: You'll manage the data - analyzing user interactions, agent behaviors, and ensuring we're making informed decisions based on metrics.<br /> - <strong>Network Engineers</strong>: You'll be essential for setting up and maintaining the server infrastructure to support a live, continuous service. </p> <p>Sorry for the long post! As i said, if you have the skills to work on something like this and are excited to build it, please DM me with how you think you can contribute and i will add you to the early community. The structure of this project is designed to reward those who invest their time and talent into making this vision a reality. When we are able to turn this into an MVP and an actual startup, equity will be given to the actors who have the most dedication and impact on its success. </p> <p>In any case, i would love to hear your thoughts and criticism on such a monumental project. Especially if you think it can't work and why. The people on this subreddit surprise me every day with how smart they are, so I truly can't wait to hear your feedback. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/FlyingJoeBiden"> /u/FlyingJoeBiden </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q4q98/an_idea/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17q4q98/an_idea/">[comments]</a></span>
