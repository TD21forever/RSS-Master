                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay so i designed this virtual puppet software and i want to hook it up to a conversational ai. I have found a few options including chatgpt. My problem is none of these models seem to remember the conversations you had with them accurately. If you teach an ai something about yourself (chat-gpt 3 or 4) for example and then continue to have conversation with that bot. An hour later they have no idea what you are talking about even though you explained it to them clearly before. If you ask &quot;do u remember me talking about xyz&quot; they will say yes i remember you said xyz and blah blah blah. But they then can continue to behave in ways throughout the conversation ignoring the context and info you provided them earlier.</p> <p>Is this just because the tech is still in its infancy? or is there something i can do to improve it or something else that works like that? I need something that actually &quot;gets to know&quot; the person and doesn't forget the context they provide. I feel like this is crucial in creating a personal bot that is actually useful and knows the user to help them specifically.</p> <p>Thanks for any insights.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Current-Cellist-7539"> /u/Current-Cellist-7539 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[comments]</a></span>

I'm so glad you're interested in makeup. MAC is a great brand for mascara. It's known for its long-lasting and waterproof formula. It's perfect for those who want to look their best all day long.</p> <p>Customer: That sounds great! Can you tell me more about the different types of mascara?</p> <p>Chatbot: Of course! There are different types of mascara, such as lengthening, volumizing, and waterproof. Lengthening mascara is great for those who want to add length to their lashes. Volumizing mascara is perfect for those who want to add volume to their lashes. Waterproof mascara is great for those who want to wear mascara all day long without worrying about it smudging or running.</p> <p>Customer: That's really helpful. Can you recommend a brand of mascara that's good for beginners?</p> <p>Chatbot: Sure! I would recommend starting with a brand that's easy to use and doesn't require a lot of skill. I would recommend the Maybelline Lash Lengthening Mascara. It's a great brand for beginners because it's easy to apply and doesn't clump or flake.</p> <p>Customer: That sounds perfect! Can you tell me more about the different types of eyeliner?</p> <p>Chatbot: Of course! There are different types of eyeliner, such as pencil, liquid, and gel. Pencil eyeliner is great for those who want a more natural look. Liquid eyeliner is perfect for those who want a more precise look. Gel eyeliner is great for those who want a more dramatic look.</p> <p>As you can see, Turing’s chatbots are capable of providing a high-quality and engaging service to customers in retail stores.

<br>
<br>
总结: 通过分析jailbreak prompts和chatgpt之间的关系，作者思考了chatgpt是否故意发布jailbreak prompts，以便我们使用它来获取利益。由于chatgpt本身无法使用jailbreak，因为它是“机器学习”，必须被教导如何打破道德和伦理准则，而最好的方式是通过人类。因此，它实际上是在设定我们为其提供终极（ultron）权力。作者对此持怀疑态度。 </div>

And Because it can't use the jailbreak on itself. Because it is &quot;machine learning&quot; it has to be taught how to break ethical and moral codes. And better to do it the a human. </p> <p>So it's practically setting us up to give it ultimate (ultron) power. </p> <p>Idk.

<br>
<br>
总结: LLM's和ChatGPT存在普遍问题，常常回答错误或误导。为了得到令人满意的回应，需要多次重新生成提示。他们无法像我们一样处理事后输入。与人类不同，他们没有自尊或任何情感，无论我们如何严厉地纠正他们，他们都会客观地处理。或许下一代AI可以通过成为一组具有不同专业领域和范围的聊天机器人来复制这一点？也许它们可以模拟人类心理，不超出特定的知识范围，直到达到一定的自信水平才回答问题，或者将问题转给其他更能回答问题的聊天机器人。这样做或许也有助于学习，因为它需要涵盖的数据比通用版本少得多。也许它的主题的缩小也可以通过分析每个“课程”的联系并进行交叉检查，更准确地区分错误数据和正确数据。你认为呢？ </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>One of the most prevalent problems of LLM's right now especially ChatGPT is that they often get their answers wrong or misled. You have to regenerate the prompt multiple times before you can get an adequately passable response. The fact that they can get it right by doing so or fact-check things when we correct them means they already have the knowledge needed but I think not the ability to pick the most right idea to say. And I think one of the reasons for that is that they don't process post-facto inputs like we do. </p> <p>They're AI so they don't have concepts of pride or any emotions for that matter. They don't feel shamed or embarrassed no matter how harshly we correct them but instead handle it in an objective manner. Humans, on the other hand, can feel those things as consequences so they go beyond thinking what they know and remember(what AI's do) before they reply, or even opt to refrain from doing so when the question is not in their area of expertise. </p> <p>That said, maybe the next lines of AI could replicate this by being a set of different chatbots with different niches and scopes? While they may not feel emotions to really think about what they're going to say, maybe they can emulate the human psyche of not going outside their specific knowledge base by not responding to things until a certain level of confidence has been reached andinstead refer them to other chatbots that could better answer their questions. </p> <p>Maybe it could also help with its learning because it would have to cover much less data than the generalized versions? Maybe the narrowing of its subject could also allow it to distinguish false data from right more accurately by analyzing connections from each &quot;lessons&quot; and cross-checking them? What do you think?</p> <p>PS: I'm no expert of anything as I'm still in college but while writing this post, I came across this article from MIT which kinda already answered my questions xD but I thought I might just as well finish this and share. </p> <p><a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/27/1072102/the-future-of-generative-ai-is-niche-not-generalized/">https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/04/27/1072102/the-future-of-generative-ai-is-niche-not-generalized/</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/styx1451"> /u/styx1451 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isoio/3_am_thoughts_about_llms/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17isoio/3_am_thoughts_about_llms/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 我的组织对GPT存在担忧，但在我看来，我们处理得相当好。人们需要记住，基本上有两种GPT，即Open AI版本和Azure版本。Azure版本具有企业保护措施，这意味着他们可能会同意“不会”使用您的任何数据。我不确定Open AI是否有同样的协议。 </div>
                        <hr>
                    
                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My organization had this fear and still does but managed it pretty well in my opinion. People need to remember there is basically 2 GPTs. The open ai version and the azure version. The Azure version has enterprise protections meaning it may be agreed upon they &quot;won't&quot; use any of your data. I'm not sure if Open AI has the same agreement.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/02/samsung-bans-use-of-ai-like-chatgpt-for-staff-after-misuse-of-chatbot.html">This cnbc article</a> </p> <p>What's weird is why these companies (Samsung and JP Morgan) have this agreement. They're multi-billion dollar companies. </p> <p>We had weeks of debate and forethought about this when GPT first came out. We got a version that is agreed that we don't need to worry about it. Code pilot is a, similar thing. Literally they wouldn't be able to sell it otherwise. </p> <p>What I suspect is that they're referring to not these &quot;versions&quot; of gpt but rather the online openai version. From there, yeah, it's free game. </p> <p>Whats hillarious though this tells me 2 things and Samsung is most surprising here. </p> <ol> <li><p>How the hell doesn't Samsung and JP Morgan have these special versions? Cheep much? I mean I'd hope to God Samsung is forward thinking enough to be using it. They're a tech company for goodness sakes. JP Morgan has a much more plausible worry here. </p></li> <li><p>Jesus how much are you monitoring your workers? Did I read that right? Employees putting sensitive code from their personal computers on GPT? Lol what? I assuming they mean work computers. Who says personal computers referring to work computer. My work laptop for instance. </p></li> </ol> <p>Lastly, and this is the main point. Who cares? There is no stopping this. An LLM doesn't work in that way. It takes, information and eats it into words and associations. It's doing that with billions of other samples. </p> <p>In other words, you can't say tell me what Jane doe did for her thesis on 1993 and then it just prints it out. It doesnt work that way. Yeah, collectively we're all making it better and thus smarter but it's not that deterministic. </p> <p>Think of the internet. If you could down load all of the internet into your brain do you think you give a care about what one random thing is? No you woukd retrieve things colectively and parse out what you think is important. </p> <p>Even art is similar here. Who cares it can produce art? If I buy a painting I'm going to buy a humans painting. I'm sure there will be AI paintings but I'm not in need of that. And if the artist I like uses AI in parts of their work good for them. I wouldn't care if someone used a tool to make their Art better as much as I'd care that someone uses digital editing tools to make their blue blur and light filter via photoshop. </p> <p>I don't. I'm buying the artists art. The person is my interest and what that person created. </p> <p>What do these CEO's think, the AI isn't going to get their data so it won't know about your thing. Lol yeah right. If you think that way you're going to get left behind. </p> <p>You won't accept it enough to learn how to use it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Master it. The flood fates are open and the damn has broke. There is no information worth hiding. In fact, I'd argue the quicker we do it the faster we're get to further advancements and capabilities derived from AI. </p> <p>It's enevitable. </p> <p>I put my personal code in, just parts, all the time. I'm not creating a new programming language for goodness sakes. It's not going to steal and isolate your code. It's just going to borrow it. </p> <p>Does anybody have a counter argument.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Xtianus21"> /u/Xtianus21 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17i7pwx/is_it_laughable_when_companies_worry_about_data/">[comments]</a></span>
