How long before AI stories will be created into real movies. AI music and AI simulated pop stars, once again the music and imagery will be so realistic, the charts will be just robots competing with new 'bands' and singers and the music itself will be better than anything any human has written because of algorithms which ensure they keep improving and improving and get better and better. We are going to end up switching on the TV and being glued to the screen unable to take our eyes off it because it's so good or unable to stop listening to the music.

According to recent Precedence Research results, the market for chatbots worldwide is expected to reach $840 million by 2022.<br /> The Web3 sector has begun to take advantage of the growing prospects surrounding AI and chatbots across multiple industries. Blockchain businesses are using AI chatbots to assist developers in building applications more quickly and effectively.<br /> Blockchain chatbots have the potential to significantly alter the game. They can assist with trade, automate transactions, and supply liquidity on decentralized exchanges. Market-making bots, for example, increase liquidity and improve the efficiency of the cryptocurrency market. For instance, NeuroChain is powered by a network of intelligent, quick, and safe bots that communicate with one another and grow in intelligence over time. In the end, they will independently identify problems and suggest fixes.<br /> AI has the potential to improve Web3 development, but adoption may be slowed by a number of issues.<br /> While AI-driven smart contracts, for instance, can hasten technological advancement, these applications frequently need throughput for on-chain execution with predictable and automated expenditure.<br /> Notwithstanding these difficulties, Van Niekerk claimed that, on the whole, AI chatbots are assisting in making Web3 more inclusive and reachable by a greater number of developers.<br /> What are your thoughts? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Junpw"> /u/Junpw </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ho3qn/blockchain_chatbots_have_the_potential_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ho3qn/blockchain_chatbots_have_the_potential_to/">[comments]</a></span>

During my research, I stumbled upon a blog post that features 8 AI applications and provides info on how to integrate them with Make.com, which is my go-to automation service. </p> <p>I thought I'd share this resource with you, especially for those who, like me, are at the early stages of their AI adventure. The blog post introduces a list of these AI apps and gives a brief overview of what each one does: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Pinecone,</strong></li> <li><strong>Synthesia,</strong></li> <li><strong>Leap AI,</strong></li> <li><strong>Mem,</strong></li> <li><strong>Chatbase,</strong></li> <li><strong>Hugging Face,</strong></li> <li><strong>ElevelLabs,</strong></li> <li><strong>OpenAI: Whisper.</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>At the same time, you also learn about Make.com <strong>templates that feature these apps</strong>. I personally find them helpful because they are pre-configured and guide you through the setup. Here are some of the tasks these templates can assist with: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Extracting data from Google Sheets and linking it with Pinecone</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: keep track of product availability and stock levels in your online store. </li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Fetching new records from Airtable and training Leap AI by using the collected data.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: automatically collect and analyze data from (e.g.) customer survey submissions.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Creating Mems from fresh Pipedrive CRM deal data.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: assess the status of various sales opportunities.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Condensing Slack message threads and producing Mems from the collected information.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: compile key takeaways and action items from extensive Slack conversations.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Crafting voiceovers from WordPress articles and connecting them to a Google Sheet.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: make blog posts and articles available in audio format.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Transcribing Zoom recordings through OpenAI's Whisper, summarizing them, generating audio files with ElevenLabs, and sharing them via Slack.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: Transcribe discussions, summarize important points, and share audio highlights with team members.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I found the post really interesting and thought it might spark your interest as well. </p> <p><strong>Link to original resource:</strong> <a href="https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai">https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai</a></p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheOppoziteOfBatman"> /u/TheOppoziteOfBatman </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 如果我看到AI、虚幻引擎、Unity等已经能够做到的事情，我就会想知道为什么你还想购买像《使命召唤》这样的知识产权。越来越多的游戏是由单个开发者或者非常小的团队制作的。甚至在《堡垒之夜》中也有很多伟大的作品。现在有了AI，我无法想象在未来十年内，AI不会通过一个简单的提示就能制作出游戏。比如：在一个类似《侠盗猎车手5》的城市中设置战区，使用《GT赛车7》的汽车物理引擎。我肯定不会投资于动视暴雪，而是会购买Unity或者虚幻引擎。然后我会在游戏通行证中提供你自己的游戏制作体验。微软的举动似乎不具备未来的保障。 </div>

I am wondering why you would wanna buy IP’s like Call of duty. </p> <p>More and more games are made by single developers or really small teams. And even inside Fortnite great things are being made. </p> <p>And now with AI I can’t imagine that AI will not,within ten years, make games just by a single prompt. Like: Warzone set in a GTA 5 like city with car physics of Gran Turismo 7. </p> <p>I certainly would not have invested in Activision but would have bought Unity or Unreal engine. Then I would offer your own game making expierence in game pass. </p> <p>Microsoft move just not feels future proof.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dennislubberscom"> /u/dennislubberscom </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hfa0u/why_did_microsoft_buy_activision/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hfa0u/why_did_microsoft_buy_activision/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 作者对于AI技术和机器学习在操作系统中的完全整合以及是否存在能够在重复任务中辅助完成的集成助手表示好奇，并提出了自己在转换PDF文件时遇到的问题和想法。作者认为，虽然目前存在宏和其他方法来简化任务，但是否有AI能够识别并自动完成这种简单但相对复杂的模式仍然是一个疑问。作者希望了解是否有类似的AI集成正在开发中，并寻求相关的例子和见解。 </div>

I tried exporting from Preview, but it was giving me one page at a time. Online PDF converters always screw up the fonts. I could probably open the PDF in Photoshop and do a big export to a bunch of different JPEG files and then insert them into a Google Slides doc, but I said screw it and decided to just take a bunch of screenshots, which also allowed me to easily crop out white space on the edges. </p> <p>As I got 3 or 4 slides in, I started to wonder, how close are we to having an integrated assistant (that you could enable/disable), that might pop up during repetitive tasks like this, and just do the rest for you? I know there are macros, and there was probably a much quicker/easier way to accomplish what I wanted to do than screenshots, but still—couldn't an AI detect that I was repeatedly selecting a border around the colored part of the PDF and creating a series of PNG images, and then just continue that pattern? This is a very simple pattern for a human mind to recognize, but it's also considerably more complex than, say, entering a series of numbers in Excel or Sheets and then dragging the little plus sign to autofill (although even that function seems surprisingly limited these days in terms of pattern recognition). </p> <p>Does anyone know if such AI integration is being worked on? Any examples? </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your insights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crumblemuppets"> /u/crumblemuppets </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17h09tl/ai_machine_learning_in_os/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17h09tl/ai_machine_learning_in_os/">[comments]</a></span>
