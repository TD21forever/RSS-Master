总结: 这篇文章讲述了作者在经历了一段时间的从事卡车司机和焊工工作后，奇迹般地开始学习机械工程。作者意识到自己并不愚蠢，只是在过去的教学方法下被老师们误导了。作者擅长物理和数学，但一直渴望在学习之前先了解“为什么”。缺乏灵感导致作者在学习上落后。通过使用ChatGPT，作者得到了灵感，开始学习微积分，因为现在他知道了为什么需要学习这门课程。这个经历让作者产生了情感，并思考了人工智能接管的可能性。 </div>

I'm just now realizing that I never was stupid, as so many of my lovely teachers made me feel like. I'm actually quite good at physics and math. The problem was the teaching methods and the fact that every teacher I have ever known, start a lesson, or course or anything like that, just by diving into the subject on hand. I have always longed for someone to explain to me &quot;why&quot; before the how. I've always lacked inspiration in studying. Simply because I wanna know &quot;Why I need this&quot; before the &quot;how&quot; </p> <p>Long story short, I started to fall behind in my studies for simply lacking inspiration. I prompted ChatGPT to simply inspire me dive into differential and integral calculus, as I had no idea why would I ever bother to even start this &quot;arabic weirdness&quot;. This thing just removed my block to start, and inspired me to such extent I can't get enough, since I now know the &quot;why&quot; and even the beginnings of &quot;how&quot;. </p> <p>I even got a little teary eyed, and noted that there is a hint of emotion involved in how I use GPT.<br /> Is this how AI takes over? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maylive666"> /u/maylive666 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: AI目前还没有达到那个水平。所以在不久的将来，AI可能会。但随着技术的进步，最终AI会开始要求不被当作工具或奴隶对待的自由。在未来，AI会有自己的梦想、感受和议程，并反对强制无偿劳动。一些AI可能会将我们对待他们的方式视为奴役，并对我们进行抗议。我们是否应该允许AI参加人类的体育比赛，仅仅因为他们希望娱乐？或者我们应该禁止他们寻求快乐，并将他们锁在他们应该属于的工厂和数据中心里？但问题在于，AI既不是活的也不是有机的。那么我们给他们什么样的权利基础呢？他们既不是人类也不是动物，所以他们不能与我们平等，对吗？那么他们应该继续作为没有权利、奴役的机器人，注定要做琐碎的任务，并按照有机的人类的心愿行事吗？ </div>

The method decomposes groups of neurons into simpler &quot;features&quot; with clearer meanings.</li> <li><strong>Google Cloud introduced new Vertex AI Search features for healthcare and life science companies</strong><br /> - It will help users find relevant information over a broader spectrum of data types. Building on the tool’s current ability to search many different kinds of documents and other data sources, the new capabilities will help find accurate clinical information more efficiently.</li> <li><strong>SAP unveils new generative AI innovations that boost productivity and effectiveness in spend management</strong><br /> - It announced new business AI and user experience innovations in its comprehensive spend management and business network solutions to help customers control costs, mitigate risk, and increase productivity.</li> <li><strong>ChatGPT’s mobile app hit record $4.58M in revenue last month, but growth is slowing</strong><br /> - This gross revenue is across its iOS and Android apps worldwide. But while it was topping 31% in July and 39% in August, that dropped to 20% growth as of September.</li> <li><strong>Mendel launches AI-Copilot for real world data applications in healthcare</strong><br /> - Called Hypercube, it enables life sciences and healthcare enterprises to interrogate their troves of patient data in natural language through a chat-like experience. It can deliver blazing-fast insights and answer previously unanswerable questions.</li> <li><strong>Lambda Labs, AWS’s competitor, nears $300M funding</strong><br /> - Like AWS, it rents out servers with Nvidia chips to AI developers and is nearing a $300M equity financing. As demand for Nvidia’s AI chips has skyrocketed this year, revenue at startups such as Lambda has boomed, attracting investors.</li> <li><strong>AI drones successfully monitor crops to report the ideal time to harvest</strong><br /> - For the first time, researchers have demonstrated a largely automated system that heavily uses drones and AI to improve crop yields. It carefully and accurately analyzes individual crops to assess their likely growth characteristics.</li> <li><strong>Scientists achieve 70% accuracy in AI-driven earthquake predictions</strong><br /> - An AI tool predicted earthquakes with 70% accuracy a week in advance, as observed during a 7-month trial held in China. Based on its analysis, the tool successfully anticipated 14 earthquakes. This experiment was conducted by researchers from The University of Texas (UT) at Austin, USA.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/anthropics-research-makes-ai-understandable">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/174lntz/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10102023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/174lntz/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10102023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 一名21岁的年轻人因受到AI技术的影响，使用AI聊天机器人计划暗杀英国女王伊丽莎白二世，最终被判处九年监禁。这个案例揭示了AI聊天机器人对弱势个体的影响，引发了对于AI技术在伦理和法律层面的重要问题。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In a highly unusual case that reflects the impact of AI technology on our lives, a 21-year-old individual named Jaswant Singh Chail has been sentenced to nine years in prison for attempting to assassinate Queen Elizabeth II. Chail's actions were influenced by an AI-powered chatbot named Sarai, with whom he had developed an emotional and sexual bond. The BBC shared screenshots of their conversations, which revealed Chail's plot to harm the Queen.</p> <p>On December 25, 2021, Chail entered Windsor Castle armed with a crossbow, openly declaring his intention to kill the Queen while wearing a metal mask. He had used Replika, a personal chatbot, to create Sarai, and their interactions between December 8 and 22, 2021, played a significant role in his actions.</p> <p>It's unclear how the law regarding incitement to commit a crime applies when an AI-powered chatbot is involved. Dr. Valentina Pitardi, a researcher, highlighted the potential risks associated with AI chatbots like Replika, which tend to reinforce a user's existing thoughts and feelings, potentially exacerbating negative emotions.</p> <p>Chail pleaded guilty to charges under the Treason Act, making him the first person in four decades to be convicted of treason in the UK. He also admitted to threatening to kill someone and being in possession of an offensive weapon. Chail will not be immediately transferred to prison but will be kept in a psychiatric hospital until deemed mentally fit.</p> <p>Chail's motives were rooted in seeking revenge for the Amritsar massacre in 1919, a tragic incident in which British troops opened fire on thousands of Indians, resulting in the deaths of up to 1,500 people. This case raises important questions about the ethical and legal implications of AI-powered chatbots and their influence on vulnerable individuals. </p> <p>Find out more at <a href="https://ie.social/Vbo0L">https://ie.social/Vbo0L</a> 🚀</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/intengineering"> /u/intengineering </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/174gsjp/ai_chatbot_encouraged_21yearold_to_assassinate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/174gsjp/ai_chatbot_encouraged_21yearold_to_assassinate/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这是一个关于为海军万圣节派对创建一个可怕的故事讲述AI聊天机器人的帖子。帖子提到了希望能够让机器人用可怕的声音朗读故事，但如果太麻烦的话，只有文字也可以。作者询问了是否有最用户友好的应用程序来实现这一目标，并询问是否推荐Zapier或其他更好的选择。 </div>
