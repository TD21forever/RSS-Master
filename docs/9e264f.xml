总结: 这篇文章讨论了在大学课程中如何引入人工智能的话题。作者分享了自己教授的一门名为“数字人文导论”的课程，其中有几周的内容是关于人工智能的。起初，作者让学生们学习监督学习的基础知识，并尝试使用Google Experiments和Artbreeder等工具，讨论深度伪造等话题。然而，随着GPT-3和DALLE-E2的问世，这些工具显得过时了。作者希望得到一些能够引起学生兴趣的、有趣且易于上手的人工智能工具，而且这些工具需要免费或提供免费试用。此外，作者还表示对使用Google Colab笔记本进行轻度使用没有意见。总之，作者希望找到那些能够给学生们带来“哇”效果的工具，因为这些学生可能只对聊天机器人和新闻中关于人工智能的内容有所了解。 </div>

When I started teaching it, I had students learn the <a href="https://www.youtubeeducation.com/watch?v=4qVRBYAdLAo">basics of supervised</a> learning and play around with <a href="https://experiments.withgoogle.com/">Google Experiments</a> and <a href="https://www.artbreeder.com/">Artbreeder</a>, and talk about deep fakes and such. The goal was to find creative/fun test cases for AI while thinking lightly about the ethical and societal consequences and things like that.</p> <p>When GPT-3 and DALLE-E2 came out, though, most of those tools feel woefully out of date. Give me some of your favorite tools that make for fun, easy introductions to AI. Everything needs to be either free or available with a free trial. Light use of Google Colab notebooks would be okay, too. I'm mainly looking for things that have that &quot;wow&quot; factor for students who may only be familiar with chatbots and things they might see about AI in the news.

It can answer like ChatGPT, run on your desktop without the need to quantize, and outperform Llama2 70B.<br /> - Based on Mistral 7b, Zephyr-7B is a smaller language model that uses supervised distillation techniques and direct distilled preference optimization to improve intent alignment and achieve top-tier performance in chat benchmarks.</li> <li><strong>A model by Twelve Labs understands video</strong><br /> - It is announcing its latest video-language foundation model Pegasus-1 along with a new suite of Video-to-Text APIs. Contrary to existing solutions that either utilizes speech-to-text conversions or rely solely on visual frame data, Pegasus-1 integrates visual, audio, and speech information to generate more holistic text from videos.</li> <li><strong>ChatGPT Plus members can upload and analyze files in the latest beta</strong><br /> - Once a file is fed to ChatGPT, it takes a few moments to digest and then do things like summarize data, answer questions, or generate data visualizations based on prompts. It can chat with pdfs, data files, and other document types. Check out the other updates in the newsletter.</li> <li><strong>Google to invest $2 billion in Anthropic</strong><br /> - It invested $500 million upfront into Anthropic earlier and had agreed to add $1.5 billion more over time. The move follows Amazon’s commitment made last month to invest $4 billion in Anthropic.</li> <li><strong>WhatsApp is working on new AI support chatbot feature</strong><br /> - It will streamline in-app issue resolution without emailing. Whatsapp will respond in a chat with AI-generated messages and users will also be able to interact with manual chat support in a few taps. The feature will also resolve common issues and answer about WhatsApp features.</li> <li><strong>Perplexity announced two new models trained in-house, pplx-7b-chat and pplx-70b-chat</strong><br /> - Both models are built on top of open-source LLMs and are available as an alpha release, via Labs and pplx-api. The AI startup claims the models prioritize intelligence, usefulness, and versatility on an array of tasks, without imposing moral judgments or limitations.</li> <li><strong>Google Bard now responds in real time and you can cut off its response</strong><br /> - Bard previously only sent a response when it was complete, but now you can view a response as it’s getting generated. You can switch between “Respond in real time” and “Respond when complete”. Like ChaGPT, you can also cut off the bot mid-response.</li> <li><strong>Citibank to grant majority of its over 40,000 coders access to generative AI</strong><br /> - As part of a small pilot program, the Wall Street giant has quietly allowed about 250 of its developers to experiment with generative AI. Now, it’s planning to expand that program to the majority of its coders next year.</li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/hf-zephyr-7b-beta-open-source-gpt35-alternative">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jy4ut/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10302023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jy4ut/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10302023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: 这篇文章讨论了工作中的努力程度和结果质量的问题。作者通过观察YouTube上的广告批评视频，指出有些广告过于普通，缺乏创意。作者认为，虽然这种低质量的内容可能会继续存在，但由于其廉价性，可能会被真正的人才所取代。因为人们不愿为可以由人工智能生成的内容支付高价，而是愿意为符合自己需求的低成本内容付费。然而，当人们支付高价时，他们期望得到高质量的内容。 </div>

While some are brilliant and fun to watch (I’m looking at you, Old Spice), some are just.. generic. In this case, he was criticizing Car ads. It was so generic, he asked CGPT to provide a script for an ad for that car brand, and it came 1-1 with reality.</p> <p>He was using 3.5, not 4.</p> <p>So my assessment is, we are going to see a lot of the lazy content staying (sadly), but really becomes so cheap, they might actually get pushed to use real talent.</p> <p>Because who is going to pay premium for a content they can generate with AI, when they can pay bucks for the low crop but tailored to our needs?

My problem is none of these models seem to remember the conversations you had with them accurately. If you teach an ai something about yourself (chat-gpt 3 or 4) for example and then continue to have conversation with that bot. An hour later they have no idea what you are talking about even though you explained it to them clearly before. If you ask &quot;do u remember me talking about xyz&quot; they will say yes i remember you said xyz and blah blah blah. But they then can continue to behave in ways throughout the conversation ignoring the context and info you provided them earlier.</p> <p>Is this just because the tech is still in its infancy? or is there something i can do to improve it or something else that works like that? I need something that actually &quot;gets to know&quot; the person and doesn't forget the context they provide. I feel like this is crucial in creating a personal bot that is actually useful and knows the user to help them specifically.</p> <p>Thanks for any insights.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Current-Cellist-7539"> /u/Current-Cellist-7539 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 澳大利亚墨尔本大学的人工智能与数字伦理中心将举办一场研讨会，讨论人工情感智能（AEI）的伦理悖论。随着全球孤独感与人工智能的快速发展日益加剧，AEI作为一种矛盾的解决方案出现。这次研讨会将深入探讨AEI人格化的趋势，即将人类固有的特质（如同理心、意识和道德）赋予伴侣聊天机器人和性机器人等AEI代理人。通过将Leavitt的社会技术系统框架与对Replika的辩证探究相结合，我们将“人工同理心”重新定义为人、技术、任务和结构之间错综复杂的关系中产生的，而非AEI本身的一种品质或能力。我们的研究揭示了一种（非）人性化的悖论：当我们将人类本质投射到AI实体上时，我们可能无意中剥夺了自己的人性，并将人类的行为简化为概率技术输出，引发人工智能与人类关系和行为的本体学模糊。 </div>

This seminar delves into the growing trend of AEI personification—the ascription of inherently human attributes, like empathy, consciousness, and morality, to AEI agents such as companion chatbots and sex robots. By intertwining Leavitt’s socio-technical systems framework and a dialectical inquiry into Replika, we recast “artificial empathy” as emerging from the intricate relationship between people, technology, tasks, and structures, rather than a quality or capability of AEI itself. Our research exposes a (de)humanisation paradox: as we project human essence onto AI entities, we might unintentionally strip ourselves of our humanity and reduce humans’ actions to probabilistic technology output, instigating an ontological blurring of human-AI relations and agencies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/artiorosie"> /u/artiorosie </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了一个人寻找两种人工智能工具的需求：一种是能够写情色和露骨内容的AI写手，类似于ChatGPT，可以根据提示进行创作；另一种是能够生成情色图片的AI图像生成器，可以根据故事或场景生成相应的图片。作者希望能找到免费版本的工具，但也愿意考虑付费服务。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hope this is the right place. I'm looking for two things:<br /> 1: an AI writer that can write erotica and explicit content. I don't want anything like Dream where you basically construct your own story. I want something like ChatGPT where you give it a prompt and it writes for you.<br /> 2: an AI image generator which can generate explicit images. What makes this tricky is that I've got several pieces of erotica that I want images for. I'd like something where I can insert the story or a scene and it generates that scene.<br /> I'd prefer free versions but am willing to consider paid services as well. Let me know if you have anything!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/MyInterestsOnly"> /u/MyInterestsOnly </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jsto8/looking_for_porn/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jsto8/looking_for_porn/">[comments]</a></span>
