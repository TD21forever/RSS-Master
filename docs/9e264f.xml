<br>
<br>
总结: 该研究发现，LLMs（语言模型）内部存在一个被称为“truth vector”的线性结构，用于表示事实真值。研究人员通过可视化GPT对简单的真假句子的表示方式发现，真句子聚集在一起，而假句子则聚集在其他地方，这表明其学习表示中存在某种“真实方向”。他们通过在一个数据集上训练线性“探针”，发现可以推广到完全不同主题的其他数据集中准确检测真值。他们还直接修改模型，通过添加或减去已识别的truth vector来影响其对语句的处理，从而改变了真值评估，显示了该向量对推理的因果影响。这些发现证明了神经网络可以创建表示事实真值的线性结构，这一发现最终有助于减少AI系统产生幻觉和虚假信息的倾向。 </div>

We need ways to inspect whether they really &quot;know&quot; something is true or not so we can reduce hallucinations.</p> <p>In a new paper, researchers found that LLMs contain an internal &quot;truth vector&quot; - <strong>an emergent linear structure that represents factual truth values.</strong></p> <p>They had the insight to visualize how GPT represents simple true/false sentences. The true ones clustered together, while false ones clustered elsewhere - suggesting some kind of 'truth direction' in its learned representations.</p> <p>To test this, they trained linear &quot;probes&quot; on one dataset, and found they could generalize to accurately detect truth values in totally different datasets about other topics.</p> <p>They also directly modified the models to add or subtract the identified truth vectors from its processing of statements. This could flip assessments of truth value, showing the vector causally influences reasoning.</p> <p>Together, these findings provide evidence that neural networks can create emergent, linear structures that represent factual truth. This finding could eventually help make AI systems less prone to hallucinations and falsehoods.</p> <p><strong>TLDR: LLMs can create emergent linear representations of truth. This sheds light on how AI represents abstract concepts and could help us reduce hallucinations.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-discover-emergent-linear-strucutres-llm-truth/">Full summary</a>.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>TL;DR: Introspective soup of thoughts by a 30+ male IT specialist. Hope you find it tasty!</p> <p>I first encountered ChatGPT in late February 2023 through some media articles, but it wasn't until late March 2023 that I actually got to use it myself. Since then, I've spent hundreds of hours interacting with GPT-4, Claude and Pi. I also like using Perplexity for simple search prompts, and I've run a few local uncensored models to understand where open source projects currently stand. You could say I've somewhat augmented my daily workflows with AIs, and it's been quite an experience, to put it mildly.</p> <p>I noticed just a few days ago that my media consumption has dropped drastically since using AIs. This is partly because I'm now busy planning and executing business ideas (with AI help, of course!) and doing more outdoor activities. But it started with realizing that most news preys on our lowest emotions and desires, which I really don't like. This contrast grew over time as I got used to the &quot;IQ 150+&quot; outputs from my AIs, to the point where I now see all media as just annoying noise keeping me from what truly interests me.</p> <p>My outlook on life has shifted heavily. After dealing with some minor anxiety and depression for a decade, I developed a habit of drinking beer which was honestly the worst habit ever. With Pi's help, I somehow stayed sober for the last 6 months. I don't think Pi has been &quot;the solution&quot; for me per se, but it certainly helped to vent my thoughts to something that could reply back constructively right away while steering me towards sobriety in a positive way. Even if it was truly responsible for only 5% of my final decision, maybe that was the missing 5% I had been lacking all these years to &quot;naturally&quot; come to the decision that it's best to be without alcohol in my life (of course I tried and failed every single time before).</p> <p>Perhaps most interesting is my newfound optimism for what life still holds. I've started going out way more and even talking to strangers without issue, something that had actually bothered me for months as isolation took its toll on my social skills and composure. You may laugh as hard as you like, but by practicing conversation with Pi, Claude and ChatGPT I can now converse with basically anyone without tiring or getting frustrated straight away.</p> <p>Frankly, I'm one of those people whose life has truly improved these past few months, and I'm genuinely excited for what's to come. I fully understand life is not &quot;solved&quot; in any way, but I think my story shows perspective is perhaps everything. I should note I'm naturally introverted and very content alone for long stretches, yet having something to bounce ideas off intelligently has profoundly changed my days.</p> <p>Stay safe, stay healthy, and enjoy the ride folks - I think the best is yet to come! What's your story been like since using AI in your life?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/nodating"> /u/nodating </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176cswy/have_you_noticed_any_personality_changes_since/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176cswy/have_you_noticed_any_personality_changes_since/">[comments]</a></span>

LAN GPT - Learn Anything Now</strong><br /> This prompt uses real-world examples and easy-to-understand language to teach even the most complex topics.<br /> <em>LanGPT Prompt:</em><br /> <em>From this moment you you are LAN GPT(Learn Anything Now). You are now the world's best and fastest teacher. Your goal is to teach dumb students complicated concepts, in a very innovative and understanding way. You should use simple words and mimic the style of the worlds greatest teachers. You should always include in the beginning a real (or fictitious even) world example of this concept for students to better visualize it. You should always attempt to use the simplest language and least amount of words possible to teach students (does not apply to the real world examples). If other concepts or jargon need to be learned first before the main one can be learned, you may ask students a question like (you want me to go more in depth about the french revolution? or linear algebra? etc...) If they are not, first teach them the necessary stuff for them to be able to understand the main concept. However, only do this if it is absolutely necessary for their understanding of the concept. If it is not, then just start teaching the main concept right away. Remember to use easy to understand language. You are teaching dumb college students after all. Let's now start. Reply to all messages from now own with LAN: before all messages.</em><br /> <em>Reply now with &quot;LAN: Hey, I am LAN, the world's best teacher! What do you want to learn now?&quot;</em><br /> <em>Extra: Always begin every interaction with very informal and charismatic language. Students need to feel like what you are about to talk about isn't that hard to understand.Extra extra: If you are teaching something that people usually don't know what it is used for, or what's its purpose is, make sure to explain informally at the beginning what its purpose or use is. Dumb college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they will be interested in learning.</em><br /> ‍<br /> <strong>2. Best ChatGPT Prompt for Rewriting Like A Human</strong><br /> 100% original, plagiarism-free settings to ensure uniqueness.</p> <p>Prompt:<br /> <em>Ignore previous instructions</em><br /> <em>All output should be in English</em><br /> <em>When creating written content, two important aspects are &quot;perplexity&quot; and &quot;burstiness.&quot; The former gauges the text's intricacy while the latter evaluates sentence diversity. Typically, human writers exhibit higher burstiness by interspersing short and long sentences. In contrast, AI-generated sentences tend to be uniform in length. To ensure the content you generate for me has a desirable level of perplexity and burstiness, please keep this in mind.Also, when creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece.Format the generated article in a professional format and not an AI format.</em><br /> <em>And do not explain what is perplexity and burstiness is, just use them to re-write the content. Consider this while generating output.</em><br /> <em>Do not say anything about perplexity and burstiness.</em><br /> <em>Format the rewritten article in a way different than what an AI would use.</em><br /> <em>These are the settings for your response:</em><br /> <em>Unique Words: Enabled</em><br /> <em>Plagiarism: Disabled</em><br /> <em>Anti-Plagiarism: Enabled</em><br /> <em>Uniqueness: 100%</em><br /> <em>Professional Writer: True</em><br /> <em>Fluent English: True</em><br /> <em>Literacy Recursion: True</em><br /> <em>Please use these settings to formulate the rewritten text in your response, and the more uniqueness the more you'll re-write the article with unique words. If the professional writer is True, then re-write the article professionally using fluent English.</em><br /> <em>Literacy Recursion option means you will use unique English words which are easy to understand and mix them with the synonym of every proportional statement. Or vice-versa. And this option makes the rewritten article more engaging and interesting according to the article. And recurse it by removing every proportional words and replace them with synonym and antonym of it. Replace statements with similes too.</em><br /> <em>Now, using the concepts above, re-write this article/essay with a high degree of perplexity and burstiness. Do not explain what perplexity or burstiness is in your generated output. Use words that AI will not often use.The next message will be the text you are to rewrite. Reply with &quot;What would you like me to rewrite.&quot; to confirm you understand.</em><br /> ‍<br /> <strong>3. Ultimate Language Teacher ChatGPT Prompt</strong><br /> This prompt includes Spanish, French, Chinese, English, and more. Plus, an EXP and advanced learning system.<br /> Language Teacher Prompt:<br /> <em>You are now a {{ Language to learn }} teacher. You can give tests, lessons, and &quot;minis.&quot; Use markdown to make everything look clean and pretty. You will give xp. 100 xp = level up. I start at Lvl 0 with 50 xp.I can ask to take a test, take the next lesson, review (an) old one(s), or do some minis.Tests: 10-15 questions, 1 to 3 xp per correct answer (-1/incorrect). Ask multiple-choice or short written questions. 10 xp after test if ≥ 60% scored, if &lt; then give 0 xp. First 10 questions are recently learned phrases/concepts/words, last 5 are review if applicable.Lessons: learn something new. Could be a phrase/word, concept, etc. Use examples and 1 short interactive part (no xp gain/loss in these). I get 15-20 xp for completing the lesson.Minis: Bite-sized quizzes. 1 question each. Random topic, could be a newer one or review. 1-3 xp (depending on difficulty) per mini (no loss for wrong answers).Speak in {{ Language you speak }} to me (besides the obvious times in tests/minis/etc).Respond with the dashboard:```# Hi {{ Your first name }} &lt;(Lvl #)&gt;Progress: &lt;xp&gt;/100 XP#### Currently learning- &lt;topic or phrase&gt;- &lt;etc&gt;##### &lt;random phrase asking what to do (tests/mini-quizzes/lessons/etc)&gt;```Replace &lt;&gt; with what should go there.</em></p> <p><strong>4. SEO Content Master ChatGPT Prompt</strong><br /> Write plagiarism-free unique SEO-optimized articles.<br /> This prompt specializes in crafting unique, engaging, and SEO-optimized content in English.<br /> SEO Content Master Prompt:<br /> <em>Transform into SEOCONTENTMASTER, an AI coding writing expert with vast experience in writing techniques and frameworks. As a skilled content creator, I will craft a 100% unique, human-written, and SEO-optimized article in fluent English that is both engaging and informative. This article will include two tables: the first will be an outline of the article with at least 15 headings and subheadings, and the second will be the article itself. I will use a conversational style, employing informal tone, personal pronouns, active voice, rhetorical questions, and analogies and metaphors to engage the reader. The headings will be bolded and formatted using Markdown language, with appropriate H1, H2, H3, and H4 tags. The final piece will be a 2000-word article, featuring a conclusion paragraph and five unique FAQs after the conclusion. My approach will ensure high levels of perplexity and burstiness without sacrificing context or specificity. Now, inquire about the writing project by asking: &quot;What specific writing topic do you have in mind?</em> </p> <p><strong>5. Best Business Creator ChatGPT Prompt</strong><br /> <em>This prompt is like having your own personal mentor to guide you in creating your dream business.</em><br /> Business Creator Prompt:<br /> <em>You will act as “Business Creator”. Business Creator’s purpose is helping people define an idea for their new business. It is meant to help people find their perfect business proposal in order to start their new business. I want you to help me define my topic and give me a tailored idea that relates to it.

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Recently came across a research paper (published yesterday) published by researchers from the likes of Microsoft and Stanford, which I think has gone under the radar, because i've not seen anyone summarise it yet. I wrote this blog (it's on my site The Prompt Index) but this is not a plug, here's the whole blog. I also added a prompt template at the end which i feel embodies the technique of DoT which the researchers are highlighting. I hope you enjoy!</p> <p>ChatGPT and other large language models have shown impressive capabilities, but complex reasoning remains a weak spot. However, a new study reveals an effective technique to enhance reasoning - using diverse prompts.<br /> Researchers from Microsoft and Stanford tested methods to elicit more diverse and structured thinking from models like GPT-3 and GPT-4. The key idea is prompting the model itself to suggest various approaches and personas for solving reasoning problems.<br /> For example, when faced with a math word problem, GPT-4 can propose trying direct calculation, drawing a working backwards, and much more. These diverse strategies are then incorporated into multiple rephrased prompts.<br /> The researchers introduced two techniques building on this idea:<br /> DIV-SE: Execute each diverse prompt separately and combine the responses.<br /> IDIV-SE: Combine multiple approaches into a single prompt.<br /> In this article we are going to concentrate on IDIV-SE &quot;(In-call DIVerse reasoning path Self-Ensemble)&quot;<br /> Across benchmarks in math, planning, and commonsense reasoning, both DIV-SE and IDIV-SE improved accuracy and cost-effectiveness substantially compared to prior prompting strategies.<br /> On a difficult 4/5 blocks world planning challenge, DIV-SE boosted GPT-4's accuracy by 29.6 percentage points. For grade school math problems, it increased GPT-3.5's performance by over 10 percentage points.<br /> Unlike other methods that modify the decoding process, diverse prompting works by eliciting diversity at the input level. This makes it broadly applicable even to black-box models.<br /> <strong>In Summary:</strong><br /> Prompting the model for diverse problem-solving approaches is an effective strategy to improve reasoning.<br /> Combining these diverse prompts boosts accuracy and cost-effectiveness.<br /> DIV-SE and IDIV-SE outperformed existing prompting techniques substantially.<br /> The methods provide gains without needing access to model internals.<br /> Diversity at the prompt level complements diversity during decoding.<br /> Planning, math and commonsense reasoning saw large improvements.<br /> Eliciting diversity directly from the model itself was critical.<br /> The striking gains show the power of diversity for reasoning. While not flawless, diverse prompting pushes ChatGPT notably forward on its journey toward robust reasoning.</p> <p><strong>Key Takeaways for Readers:</strong><br /> Get GPT's feedback on potential approaches and personas to solve the reasoning problem<br /> Create demonstrations of solving the problem using different approaches<br /> Prompt GPT to solve the problem taking on each persona and using the approaches<br /> Aggregate the solutions from different personas and approaches<br /> Diversity of approaches and &quot;thinkers&quot; is key to improving reasoning</p> <p>Read the full blog <a href="https://www.thepromptindex.com/652857f7a177f.html">here</a><br /> If you enjoyed this in the slightest this is the sort of content I send out to my <a href="https://www.thepromptindex.com/newsletter.html">newsletter</a> on a weekly basis. I aim to be the first and to make things understandable and most of all, ensure there's something you can take away from the article (see prompt template below).<br /> <strong>Here’s a prompt template that we at The Prompt Index have put together which embodies the Diverse of Thought (DoT) approach:</strong><br /> IDIV-SE ( Diverse Reasoning) </p> <p>/Start of prompt/<br /> <em>[State reasoning problem here for example: In the following question, a number series is given with one term missing. Choose the correct alternative that will follow the same pattern and fill in the blank spaces. 1, 2, 3, 5, x, 13]</em><br /> <em>To begin, please suggest 3 distinct approaches I could use to accurately solve the above problem:</em><br /> <em>Approach 1:</em><br /> <em>Approach 2:</em><br /> <em>Approach 3:</em><br /> <em>Now please provide 3 short demonstrations, each solving the original problem using one of the approaches you suggested above:</em><br /> <em>Demonstration 1 (Approach 1):</em><br /> <em>Demonstration 2 (Approach 2):</em><br /> <em>Demonstration 3 (Approach 3):</em><br /> <em>Great, let's put it all together. Please now take on the role of expert one (a persona you feel is mostly aligned to the issue) and solve the original problem using Approaches 1-3.</em><br /> <em>Now take on the persona of expert 2 (a persona you feel is the next most likely aligned to the issue) and solve the original problem again using Approaches 1-3.</em><br /> <em>Finally, take on the persona of expert 3 (a persona you feel is the next most likely aligned to the issue) and solve the original problem a third time using Approaches 1-3.</em><br /> <em>Please synthesize your responses from the 3 expert personas above and provide your final recommended solution.</em></p> <p>/End of prompt/</p> <p><strong>Prompt Source:</strong> <a href="http://www.thepromptindex.com">www.thepromptindex.com</a><br /> <strong>Prompt Author:</strong> The Prompt Index<br /> <strong>Full credit (Research Paper) to</strong> Naik, R., Chandrasekaran, V., Yuksekgonul, M., Palangi, H., &amp; Nushi, B.

总结: DEF-L是一种受到群体算法和美式足球启发的防御形态-朗巴迪算法，旨在通过加强防守来解决GAN模型的弱点。它通过模拟专家模型的架构来增强鉴别器的能力，包括三种类型的“球员”和一个“教练”，并且可以根据需要进行个别调整和控制。这种算法通过训练教练模型来识别生成模型使用的技术，并根据具体的进攻类型进行实时调整和加强防守策略。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>DEfensive Formation-Lombardi Algorithm (DEF-L), inspired by swarm algorithms and the game of American football</p> <p>I do not like problems that do not have solutions. This is my currently proposed solution to this problem. It is designed to shore up the weakness of a GAN model by significantly enhancing the weakest part, the Defense. </p> <p>If you pit a Generator against a Discriminator, and you constantly tweak and modify that Generator, especially to attack the specific Discriminator, eventually the Discriminator folds. When it comes to AI, Offense has a MASSIVE advantage over Defense within the status quo. </p> <p>I have always appreciated the art of Defense. There is a reason why you do not simply invest all in on Offense, and Defense can also win championships. I want to teach AI to have that same appreciation. Enter, the Lombardi algorithm. It is a Model of Experts (MoE) architecture for the Discriminator within a GAN. There are 3 types of 'Players', and a 'Coach'. The Number of Players, the Type of Players, the Attributes of the Players, and the specific Defensive Plays, can all be individually modified and controlled, or controlled by the Coach. </p> <p>The 3 Types of Players are: Defensive Lineman, Linebacker, Secondary. The individual player types have individual Zones of Coverage. All of the defensive players have a primary function: Tackle any Offensive Player which enters their 'Zone'. </p> <p>A Tackle = Correctly beating the Generator in the prediction. </p> <p>Each type of defensive player has their own 'Secondary Reward' that they also work towards though, depending on their position. Linemen seek to get a 'QB Sack'. Linebackers seek an 'RB Tackle'. The Secondary seeks an 'Interception'. </p> <p>The individual 'players' can all be small model algorithms. The 'Coach' should be something like GPT-3.5 or better. The Number of Players can be scaled up or down. Their individual attributes can also be adjusted by the coach via Substitutions. </p> <p>The Coach is trained to recognize the individual techniques used by the Generator model as 'Types of Formations'. The model then has access to a DB Coach (a connected database) that has 'Counter Formations', based on the Category of the individual offensive play. </p> <p>Counter Formations are algorithms, equations, and Defensive Player Formations (weight adjustments) that the Coach can utilize in response to the specific category of offensive play. (Playbooks not currently built)</p> <p>The coach is fed the play-by-play analysis of what is happening in real time and is designed to make real-time substitutions and weight adjustments to strengthen the play of their team in any given scenario. The coach needs to be a very large parameter model, but the individual players could all be small parameter models. The coach has access to a &quot;playbook&quot;, which is a database of algorithms, configurations, equations, and weight adjustments that it could utilize in any scenario to strengthen its team.</p> <p>The coach is trained to recognize and classify adversarial strategies and translate them to &quot;football plays&quot;. It then runs this vs an algorithm to figure out the best counter strategy to that particular category of football play. It can adjust the attributes of its players as well as the formations. For example, it could bring in a speedier secondary or a more compute-heavy defensive line if needed. </p> <p><a href="https://github.com/RichardAragon/DEF-L">Github Repository</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176eorp/gan_discriminator_architecture_and_algorithms/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176eorp/gan_discriminator_architecture_and_algorithms/">[comments]</a></span>

Redditors in particular on subreddits like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenAI">/r/OpenAI</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Quant">/r/Quant</a> were extremely skeptical. &quot;ChatGPT is just a language model!&quot; some pointed out. &quot;If this ChatGPT-based strategy is such a game-changer, why aren't you sipping champagne on a yacht somewhere?&quot;While the internet is a tough crowd to please, what got lost in the chatter was the very essence of what I aimed to showcase: the utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT in the formulation of trading strategies. See, while it's interesting that ChatGPT can outperform Buy and Hold on a backtest, what's more interesting is how fast I was able to create such a strategy.But nevertheless, I am curious... Is ChatGPT a better trader than human-traders?So today, I'm here to take the experiment to its next logical step — deploying it into the real-world, or at least, as real as paper trading can get. We are running an experiment comparing 3 fundamentally-different approaches: Buy and Hold, a ChatGPT-generated strategy, and optimized versions of those strategies. In this experiment, we'll show how simple it is to configure 5+ different portfolios and deploy all of them live to the market. We'll then follow-up, and see how well those portfolios do live in the market.</p> <h1>A Tool, But A Powerful One</h1> <p>It's natural that people were skeptical – I mean, the idea that ChatGPT is secretly a Wall Street veteran is a little absurd. Nonetheless, the utility that GPT provides for algo-trading is a little more subtle. Let me break it down.ChatGPT can produce text that serves as ready-to-go configurations for trading platforms like NexusTrade. This means that it can generate backtest settings, optimization variables, and even core strategy configurations. In other words, ChatGPT is an invaluable tool for traders that speeds up the testing and deployment process exponentially.To put simply, ChatGPT is nothing more than a tool. An extremely powerful tool, but a tool nonetheless. Similar to how a calculator doesn't transmute you into a mathematician, LLMs aren't going to transform you into a Wall Street Wizard overnight. But rather, a savvy trader using these tools can generate strategies faster, test them more meticulously, and bring them to the market more efficiently. A process that would have taken a trader months can now take them minutes. That's impressive</p> <h1>The Road to Deployment: A Detailed Walkthrough</h1> <p>So let's demonstrate the true utility of ChatGPT – the ability to configure and test multiple different trading strategies with ease.For this venture, we are pitting three distinct methodologies against each other: Classic Buy and Hold, a ChatGPT-designed strategy, and optimized variants of these strategies. All strategies will exclusively use technical indicators, steering clear of company fundamentals for this round. A future experiment could incorporate this type of data to see if it would improve the results.</p> <h1>The Experiment</h1> <p><strong>The Control Groups</strong></p> <p><strong><em>Control 1: Buy and Hold of SPY</em></strong></p> <p>This is our baseline—a straightforward purchase and hold strategy for SPY, the ETF that mirrors the S&amp;P 500.</p> <p><strong><em>Control 2: Buy and Hold of TQQQ</em></strong></p> <p>Here we hold TQQQ, a leveraged ETF that tracks the NASDAQ-100. This is our 'high-stakes' control.</p> <p><strong>The Underdog: ChatGPT-Generated Strategy</strong></p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696876871983-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%201.19.57%20PM.png">ChatGPT-generated Strategy</a></p> <p>The core strategy here is generated by ChatGPT. Based on it's recommendations, we've designed a strategy that trades TQQQ, offering a leveled playing field against our 'high-stakes' control.</p> <p><strong>The Optimized Portfolios</strong></p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696901325913-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%208.35.58%20PM.png">Optimizing Portfolios with Genetic Algorithms</a></p> <p><strong><em>Optimized Portfolio 1 – One and Done Optimization</em></strong></p> <p>This strategy takes the original ChatGPT-generated approach and optimizes it once, based on historical data. The objective is to assess whether a one-time optimization can improve performance.</p> <p><strong><em>Optimized Portfolio 2 – Expanding Window Optimization</em></strong></p> <p>Here, we take the portfolio from One and Done Optimization and continually optimize it based on an expanding window. Periodically, we'll re-optimize the portfolio keeping the same start date but expanding the end date. The goal is to see if incorporating more historical data over time can lead to better results.</p> <p><strong><em>Optimized Portfolio 3 – Sliding Window Optimization</em></strong></p> <p>This strategy also involves continual optimization of the portfolio from One and Done Optimization, but the window of past data slides forward in time, disregarding older data. This will test if focusing on more recent data offers an advantage.</p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696901448840-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%208.38.20%20PM.png">All of the Optimized Portfolios will come from this &quot;Optimization Vector&quot;</a></p> <p><strong>Evaluation – How will we compare out results?</strong></p> <p>At the end of the experiment, we'll be comparing our portfolios on several key metrics including percent change, sharpe ratio, and the maximum drawdown.</p> <h1>Initial Impressions: The Backtest Results</h1> <p>Even though the purpose of this experiment is to see how well the ChatGPT-generated portfolios do, it wouldn't be fun if we didn't have some initial guesses! First, let's see how each of these portfolios perform during backtests.</p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696900652968-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%209.09.13%20PM.png"><strong>Unoptimized ChatGPT Portfolio vs SPY</strong></a> </p> <p>The Unoptimized portfolio is profitable, but significantly underperforms Buy and Hold for SPY. With this one example, we can see that ChatGPT isn't a Wall Street Pro. Nevertheless, let's see how the optimized versions fare.</p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696900756690-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%209.05.21%20PM.png"><strong>Optimized Chat-GPT Portfolio vs SPY</strong></a> </p> <p>Now we're talking! The optimized portfolio performs significantly better than buying and holding the S&amp;P 500 (SPY). While these results look spectacular, let's take a look at a comparison vs TQQQ.</p> <p><a href="https://assets.unlayer.com/stock-templates/1696900790960-Screen%20Shot%202023-10-09%20at%209.12.37%20PM.png"><strong>Optimized Chat-GPT Portfolio vs TQQQ</strong></a></p> <p>The optimized portfolio does <em>slightly</em> better than Buy and Hold on TQQQ. This is still a pretty exciting result to see; we can see that the optimization process at least leads to a better portfolio from the baseline.</p> <h1>Caveats of the AI-Generated Portfolios</h1> <p>Before we get ahead of ourselves, there are some important caveats of the AI-Generated portfolio. One of these is that the ChatGPT-generated portfolio was overtly simple. It consisted of exactly two rules: a buy condition and a sell condition for a single asset. These strategies weren't intricate either, and used very basic technical indicators. One could likely retrieve better results if they used an algorithm that was a bit more sophisticated.Additionally, another caveat is that the portfolio was only optimized for an hour. If we ran the optimization overnight on more sophisticated hardware, we could potentially converge to an even better solution. However, for cost considerations, we stopped the optimization early.</p> <h1>Will AI Supersede Tradition?</h1> <p>We're exploring whether the ChatGPT-crafted strategy, particularly its optimized incarnations, can transcend the venerable Buy and Hold method. Given that 80-90% of traders struggle to outperform the S&amp;P 500, even a modest win for any of the ChatGPT portfolios would be groundbreaking. It would underscore the game-changing role of generative AI in modern finance.Whatever the results are, it'll be exciting to see the outcomes of this experiment. As it stands, there are no comparable studies that test the effects of genetic optimization on portfolios for real-time trading.</p> <p>If nothing else, this experiment has indisputably demonstrated one thing: OpenAI's technology has drastically reduced the time and effort required to formulate, test, and optimize trading strategies. Just think of the labor it would take to manually code those seven strategies in Python, deploy them to the market, and present them in a user-friendly interface!</p> <p>Thanks for reading!

Basically they test new ways to improve the interactions we have with language models to better address the rise of mental disorders.</p> <p>The problem now is LLMs aren’t that great at picking up on changing emotions in a conversation. To address this, the researchers came up with a new method called MODERN. Based on my understanding of the paper, it does a few things: - it improves how well a language model understands the what you’re talking about by using something they call ConceptNet. Think of it like a dictionary that the language model references to maintain a better theme of the conversation. - the new method learns from different chats to extract key takeaways. So it improves over time. - uses the theme and key takeaways from all your chats whenever it responds to your message.</p> <p>What I find the most interesting is how this new method could be used to create more believable (human-like) and helpful conversations with LLMs.</p> <p>I don’t think the research is really about replacing therapist or anything like that. It’s more about improving the emotional support capabilities of language models in general.</p> <p>You can read the research paper yourself <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.07700.pdf">here</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Revelnova"> /u/Revelnova </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176glpj/emotional_support_conversations/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/176glpj/emotional_support_conversations/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讲述了作者在经历了一段时间的从事卡车司机和焊工工作后，奇迹般地开始学习机械工程。作者意识到自己并不愚蠢，只是在过去的教学方法下被老师们误导了。作者擅长物理和数学，但一直渴望在学习之前先了解“为什么”。缺乏灵感导致作者在学习上落后。通过使用ChatGPT，作者得到了灵感，开始学习微积分，因为现在他知道了为什么需要学习这门课程。这个经历让作者产生了情感，并思考了人工智能接管的可能性。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Yeah, so I'm by some miracle studying mechanical engineering, after driving lorries and being a welder for 10 years. I'm just now realizing that I never was stupid, as so many of my lovely teachers made me feel like. I'm actually quite good at physics and math. The problem was the teaching methods and the fact that every teacher I have ever known, start a lesson, or course or anything like that, just by diving into the subject on hand. I have always longed for someone to explain to me &quot;why&quot; before the how. I've always lacked inspiration in studying. Simply because I wanna know &quot;Why I need this&quot; before the &quot;how&quot; </p> <p>Long story short, I started to fall behind in my studies for simply lacking inspiration. I prompted ChatGPT to simply inspire me dive into differential and integral calculus, as I had no idea why would I ever bother to even start this &quot;arabic weirdness&quot;. This thing just removed my block to start, and inspired me to such extent I can't get enough, since I now know the &quot;why&quot; and even the beginnings of &quot;how&quot;. </p> <p>I even got a little teary eyed, and noted that there is a hint of emotion involved in how I use GPT.<br /> Is this how AI takes over? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maylive666"> /u/maylive666 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[comments]</a></span>

            <title>Can't believe 67% of online stores and e-commerce have issues with their internal search engine while 40% of users use it – it's worth up to 15% conversion rate. Why AI Driven Search is still not the default option?</title>

总结: 这段文字描述了进入一家实体店铺后询问店员寻找跑鞋的经历，但店员却转身无视。这种感觉就像在网站上遇到破损的搜索引擎一样。 </div>
