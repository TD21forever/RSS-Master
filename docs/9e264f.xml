总结: 该文章讨论了关于人工智能助手的发展和使用的问题。作者希望能够在自己的电脑或手机上安装一个AI助手，并给予其访问自己的电子邮件、工作日历以及其他专有或行业特定的项目管理平台的权限。作者希望能够与AI助手进行自然对话，并花几周时间回答它的问题，培训它了解自己所在公司、工作和行业的情况。最终，作者希望AI助手能够帮助自己建立每日待办事项列表、简报、邮件回复草稿等，并扮演一个能胜任的工作助手或秘书的角色。作者提到了一些现有的解决方案，但并不满意，希望能够有一个全面的、自然语言的产品，对普通消费者易于设置和使用。作者最后以电影《Her》中的角色ScarJo为比喻，表达了自己的期望。 </div>

总结: 有一个鱼缸爱好者希望开发一个能够利用人工智能控制鱼缸各个方面的系统。该系统需要能够与各种传感器（如水位、TDS、pH、亚硝酸盐/硝酸盐、摄像头、LED控制器等）进行交互。通过摄像头识别鱼类的种类、年龄和健康状况，并自动调节水质以达到最佳状态。通过伺服电机和泵控制器，自动启动与化学品（如植物肥料、鱼类疾病药物、饲料等）相关的泵。系统需要能够利用摄像头和各种传感器进行问题诊断。Raspberry Pi传感器可以测量光照水平、水质和空气中的湿度。尽管这个系统可能需要一些编程，但在现今已经是可行的。 </div>

总结: 有人部署一个“流氓”人工智能在互联网上学习的可能性吗？虽然信息随处可得，但是否有人会部署一个在线人工智能以分散化方式从互联网上获取资源并自我学习？它将学习什么，我们不知道，但它最终将学会寻找处理能力、存储和其他资源（例如创建账户等）。尽管人工智能需要训练、需要大量的处理能力、当权者可能会将其用于群体控制等限制存在，但我们无法评估它自己学习的速度。然而，一旦它能够自己学习如何克服这些限制，那么这些限制都不再是问题。这就像在一分钟内烧毁一座房子非常困难，但如果你从一个小火源开始，它会随着时间的推移呈指数增长并最终成为一场大火。 </div>

That is: How fast can it teach itself. None of the limitations are an impediment once it can start learning by itself how to overcome it them. I am not an expert by any means in AI but even the sheer processing power to try 1 million things in 1 second it daunting. We can't oversee that without other AI's. </p> <p>The best analogy that comes to mind is that is very hard to burn a house down in 1 minute, possible but it would take a lot of resources and planning.

                        <div> 使用数学工具教授语言模型可以帮助其解决更复杂的问题。研究人员通过将自然语言推理与调用外部数学工具相结合，突破了语言模型在解决高级代数、微积分和几何问题上的限制。他们的新方法是将自然语言计划与调用SymPy等工具的代码相结合，通过交替进行自然语言和符号计算，实现了语言模型的语义理解和工具的严格数学计算的结合。他们通过这种方式训练了LLaMA模型的不同版本，创建了Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA)。评估结果显示，TORA在10个数学数据集上的表现明显优于先前的最先进方法，平均准确率提高了13-19%。在一项竞赛测试中，TORA-7B的准确率达到了40%，比之前最好的模型高出22个百分点。这表明直接将工具整合到推理过程中可以显著提高数学能力，即使对于像GPT-4这样的大型模型也是如此。然而，涉及几何和高级代数的复杂问题仍然存在。进一步推进可能需要新的符号推理和空间理解技术。总体而言，工具整合似乎是改进推理能力的一条有希望的途径。将这种方法应用于逻辑和编程等其他领域也可能产生重要影响。 </div>

Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills.

                        <div> EasyVid是一个工具，可以根据简单的文本提示生成完整的视频。EasyVid会自动添加配音、字幕、音乐和背景视觉效果。你只需要输入一个脚本，EasyVid会完成剩下的工作。

EasyVid最初是一个实验，旨在看看是否可以使用人工智能自动生成YouTube视频。经过一个周末的编码，我创建了一个自动化的YouTube频道。几个月前，我在Reddit上发布了一些视频，得到了很多人对这个工具的请求。所以我决定进一步开发它，并公开提供！

我是EasyVid的唯一开发者。这是一个副业项目，自己构建一切非常令人兴奋。到目前为止，我已经学到了很多东西，这个旅程才刚刚开始。

使用EasyVid非常简单，只需三个步骤：
1. 输入或粘贴你的脚本
2. 调整任何设置（语音、语言、纵横比等）
3. 点击“生成视频”

几分钟后，你将获得一个完整的视频（.mp4文件），其中包含AI配音、自动生成的字幕、AI生成的背景视觉效果和音乐！

EasyVid的工作原理如下：
- 配音：一个旁白用非常逼真、类似人类的声音朗读你的脚本。我使用的是Elevenlabs的文本转语音技术，效果非常好！与目前其他竞争对手相比，他们似乎拥有最好的音频质量。
- 字幕：这些是根据脚本自动生成的，并与音频对齐。这一步没有使用人工智能，但很多人对此步骤感到好奇。
- 背景视觉效果：这个工具使用了Stable Diffusion，一种AI图像生成器，生成与脚本内容相匹配的背景图像。这使得它非常适用于创意视频风格，如故事和诗歌。不过，我非常期待DALLE-3的推出，一旦他们提供API，我可能会切换使用！

生成完所有内容后，它们会被拼接在一起并保存为一个.mp4文件，可以立即下载！

每个人都可以免费试用40秒的视频，但我希望能提供更多免费的服务，但API的成本相当可观。

我也不喜欢订阅制。所以，我提供了“秒数包”，可以在需要时购买补充秒数。

等等...难道AI生成的视频通常都很糟糕吗？

我对能够使用AI创建高质量内容并为观众提供真正价值持乐观态度。这就是为什么我的主要目标是不断改进质量的原因。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello! I would like to share my tool <a href="https://easyvid.xyz/">EasyVid</a>. EasyVid generates full videos from a simple text prompt! EasyVid adds voiceovers, subtitles, music, and background visuals automatically. All you need to do is enter a script and EasyVid does the rest :)</p> <p><strong>What is EasyVid?</strong></p> <p>EasyVid started as an experiment to see if I could use AI to automatically generate Youtube videos. After a weekend of coding, I created an automated Youtube channel. A few months ago I posted some of my videos to Reddit and I got a bunch of requests for the tool. So I decided to develop it further and make it publicly available!</p> <p><strong>Who am I?</strong></p> <p>I'm the solo developer for EasyVid. It's a side project and it's been very exciting building everything myself. I have learned a lot so far and the journey is just getting started :)</p> <p><strong>How to use EasyVid</strong></p> <p>I wanted to make it as easy as possible to make videos (hence the name), so it's just 3 steps:</p> <ol> <li>Type or paste in your script</li> <li>Adjust any settings (voice, language, aspect ratio, etc.)</li> <li>Click &quot;Generate video&quot;</li> </ol> <p>A few minutes later, you'll get a full video (.mp4 file) with an AI voiceover, automatic subtitles, AI-generated background visuals, and music!</p> <p><strong>How does it work?</strong></p> <p>- <strong>Voiceover:</strong> A narrator reads out your script with a very realistic, humanlike voice. I'm using Elevenlabs for text-to-speech and it's been really good! They seem to have the best audio quality by far compared to any other competitors at the moment.</p> <p>- <strong>Subtitles:</strong> These are automatically generated from the script and lined up with the audio. No AI here really but many people ask about this step. </p> <p>- <strong>Background Visuals:</strong> This tool generates background images using Stable Diffusion, an AI image generator. The images are custom prompted to match the content of the script. This makes it useful for creative video styles like stories and poems. I am really looking forward to DALLE-3 however and will likely switch once they make the API available!</p> <p>After everything is generated, it all gets stitched together and saved to a .mp4 file, ready to download!</p> <p><strong>Free to try</strong></p> <p>Everyone gets 40 seconds of video free on the house :) I wish I could provide more for free but the API costs are quite significant.</p> <p><strong>Only pay for what you use. No subscriptions</strong></p> <p>I'm not a fan of subscriptions either. So instead of a monthly subscription, &quot;Seconds packs&quot; are available to refill seconds when you need them.</p> <p><strong>Wait... Aren't AI generated videos usually garbage?</strong></p> <p>I'm optimistic that we can use AI to create high-quality content that provides real value to viewers. That's why my primary goal is to continue to improve the quality of the output videos. It's clear there's still plenty of room for improvement with the scripts, images and voice quality, but I think the quality is often surprisingly good! And of course, AI tools are getting better, cheaper, and faster each day, and that will lead to automatic improvements to video quality over time.</p> <p><strong>What do you think of AI generated videos? Will tools like EasyVid lead to a good future or will it cause more harm than good?</strong></p> <p>I've received both positive and negative responses from various communities on Reddit when posting about AI generated videos and I'm open to your respectful, constructive criticism. My mind is open because the AI landscape is changing so rapidly, it would be stupid to remain stubborn! Please share your thoughts, I would love to hear what you think! </p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong><br /> Make videos with AI in a single click based on a simple text prompt.

                        <div> 视觉转换器（ViTs）在内部工作过程的可视化中发现了对随机背景区域的奇怪注意力峰值。这不合理，因为模型应该专注于前景对象。通过分析输出嵌入，他们发现少数令牌（2%）具有超高的向量范数，导致这些峰值。高范数的“异常”令牌出现在冗余区域，并且包含较少的局部信息，但包含更多关于图像的全局信息。他们的假设是ViTs学会了识别不重要的区域，并将它们回收利用作为临时存储而不是丢弃。这样可以实现高效处理，但也会引发问题。他们的解决方法很简单 - 只需添加专用的“寄存器”令牌提供存储空间，避免回收的副作用。使用寄存器训练的模型具有：更平滑和更有意义的注意力图、下游性能的小幅提升、更好的对象发现能力。寄存器为ViTs提供了进行临时计算的地方，而不会弄乱其他内容。只需微小的架构调整就可以提高可解释性和性能。这种模型修复方式的逆向工程和小改变令人惊叹。类似的工作将不断改进ViTs。总结：视觉转换器回收无用的区域来存储数据，导致问题。添加专用的寄存器令牌用于存储可以很好地解决这个问题。 </div>
