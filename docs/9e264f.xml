                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>In today's digital landscape, where our data is a precious commodity, cybersecurity is paramount. We are confronted by increasingly sophisticated threats, and our defence mechanisms must evolve accordingly. Enter Artificial Intelligence (AI), which is playing a pivotal role in transforming the field of cybersecurity.</p> <p>Enhancing Threat Detection: We are talking about innovative technology that delves into massive datasets, sifting through intricate patterns to uncover anomalies that may signify cyber threats. This initiative-taking approach serves as a formidable defence against malicious activities, including malware invasions, phishing schemes, and unusual network behaviours.</p> <p>Anomaly Detection: Cybersecurity systems are armed with AI-driven algorithms that work round the clock, scrutinizing network, and system activities. Any deviations from the usual norms trigger alerts, ensuring that peculiar patterns do not escape notice, and threats are promptly addressed.</p> <p>Predictive Analysis: Using historical data, predictive analysis allows organizations to foresee potential cyber threats and vulnerabilities. This means taking strategic actions in advance to thwart impending attacks or vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Automation of Incident Response: Automation is the linchpin when it comes to having and mitigating the damage inflicted by cyberattacks. With AI's help, response actions are started swiftly, minimizing response times, and curtailing the extent of the damage caused by these incidents.</p> <p>User Behaviour Analysis: Monitoring and analysing user actions for anomalies is fundamental in preventing unauthorized access and insider threats. This constant vigilance over user behaviour helps in detecting any suspicious activities that may pose a security risk.</p> <p>Adaptive Security Measures: Embracing an adaptive security approach, these systems continuously learn from new data, swiftly adapting security protocols to stay in tune with emerging threats. This adaptability is indispensable in a world marked by the constant evolution of sophisticated cyber risks.</p> <p>Phishing Detection: These systems shine when it comes to finding phishing attempts. They evaluate email content and sender behaviours, serving as the first line of defence against fraudulent communications that could otherwise jeopardize sensitive information.</p> <p>Zero-Day Exploit Detection: This kind of detection recognizes vulnerabilities and attacks that have not been previously found. It relies on patterns and behaviours shown by zero-day exploits, effectively thwarting attacks before they can unleash chaos.</p> <p>Vulnerability Assessment: Using AI tools, organizations can systematically assess and scan networks and systems for potential vulnerabilities, enabling initiative-taking measures to eliminate weak points that cybercriminals could exploit.</p> <p>Network Traffic Analysis: By analysing network traffic, the system can unearth indications of potentially harmful or malicious activities. This initiative-taking approach ensures that threats are detected in real-time.</p> <p>Secure Authentication: With biometric authentication and behavioural analysis, these systems provide an added layer of security, ensuring that only authorized users gain access to sensitive systems and data.</p> <p>Security Analytics: In a world inundated with security data, AI-powered analytics tools distill this information into actionable insights. This empowers security teams to make informed decisions about potential threats and vulnerabilities.</p> <p>Bot Detection: Identifying and blocking malicious bots is a critical defence measure, especially for web applications and online services. These safeguards protect against automated attacks.</p> <p>Security Monitoring: With real-time, continuous monitoring of security events, these systems generate alerts in response to suspicious activities. This ensures that potential threats are quickly found and addressed.</p> <p>Incident Investigation: Post-incident analysis and investigation are bolstered by the capabilities of AI. These systems provide valuable insights and data analysis to help organizations understand the nature and scope of security incidents.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Cygnet-Digital"> /u/Cygnet-Digital </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jo96n/how_ai_transforms_cybersecurity/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jo96n/how_ai_transforms_cybersecurity/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Okay so i designed this virtual puppet software and i want to hook it up to a conversational ai. I have found a few options including chatgpt. My problem is none of these models seem to remember the conversations you had with them accurately. If you teach an ai something about yourself (chat-gpt 3 or 4) for example and then continue to have conversation with that bot. An hour later they have no idea what you are talking about even though you explained it to them clearly before. If you ask &quot;do u remember me talking about xyz&quot; they will say yes i remember you said xyz and blah blah blah. But they then can continue to behave in ways throughout the conversation ignoring the context and info you provided them earlier.</p> <p>Is this just because the tech is still in its infancy? or is there something i can do to improve it or something else that works like that? I need something that actually &quot;gets to know&quot; the person and doesn't forget the context they provide. I feel like this is crucial in creating a personal bot that is actually useful and knows the user to help them specifically.</p> <p>Thanks for any insights.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Current-Cellist-7539"> /u/Current-Cellist-7539 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jdt1k/why_does_ai_not_remember_the_conversations_youve/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
<br>
总结: 澳大利亚墨尔本大学的人工智能与数字伦理中心将举办一场研讨会，讨论人工情感智能（AEI）的伦理悖论。随着全球孤独感与人工智能的快速发展日益加剧，AEI作为一种矛盾的解决方案出现。这次研讨会将深入探讨AEI人格化的趋势，即将人类固有的特质（如同理心、意识和道德）赋予伴侣聊天机器人和性机器人等AEI代理人。通过将Leavitt的社会技术系统框架与对Replika的辩证探究相结合，我们将“人工同理心”重新定义为人、技术、任务和结构之间错综复杂的关系中产生的，而非AEI本身的一种品质或能力。我们的研究揭示了一种（非）人性化的悖论：当我们将人类本质投射到AI实体上时，我们可能无意中剥夺了自己的人性，并将人类的行为简化为概率技术输出，引发人工智能与人类关系和行为的本体学模糊。 </div>

This seminar delves into the growing trend of AEI personification—the ascription of inherently human attributes, like empathy, consciousness, and morality, to AEI agents such as companion chatbots and sex robots. By intertwining Leavitt’s socio-technical systems framework and a dialectical inquiry into Replika, we recast “artificial empathy” as emerging from the intricate relationship between people, technology, tasks, and structures, rather than a quality or capability of AEI itself. Our research exposes a (de)humanisation paradox: as we project human essence onto AI entities, we might unintentionally strip ourselves of our humanity and reduce humans’ actions to probabilistic technology output, instigating an ontological blurring of human-AI relations and agencies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/artiorosie"> /u/artiorosie </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17jjtat/unpacking_the_ethical_paradoxes_of_humanai/">[comments]</a></span>

This has inspired me to pursue a career in AI for cancer research and innovation in cancer vaccines. I have one year of software development experience, but I am a beginner in AI. Can anyone please guide me on how to get started? I am looking for resources and advice on how to build my skills and knowledge in this area.</p> <p>I am particularly interested in learning about how AI can be used to speed up the development of new cancer vaccines or in immunotherapy. I believe that AI has the potential to make a real difference in the fight against cancer, and I am eager to contribute.</p> <p>Thank you in advance for your help!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/AshwinKol"> /u/AshwinKol </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17j1dlo/how_to_get_started_in_ai_for_cancer_research_and/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17j1dlo/how_to_get_started_in_ai_for_cancer_research_and/">[comments]</a></span>
