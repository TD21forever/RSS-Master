总结: OpenAI成立了一个“应对准备”团队，以支持高度智能AI的安全性。该团队将紧密联系能力评估、评估和内部红队测试，从我们近期开发的模型到具有AGI级能力的模型。该团队将帮助跟踪、评估、预测和防范涵盖多个类别的灾难性风险，包括核威胁。Google扩大了其针对GenAI的漏洞赏金计划，并在开源安全工作上进行了扩展，并在之前与开源安全基金会的合作基础上进行了建设。此外，Google将支持非营利性MLCommons协会的新努力，以开发标准的AI安全基准。Boston Dynamics利用ChatGPT将其机器狗Spot变成了一个会说话的导游。Spot可以跑、跳，甚至跳舞，现在它还可以回答关于公司设施的问题并生成回应，同时进行导览。Forbes现在拥有自己的GenAI搜索引擎。这个名为Adelaide的工具专为新闻搜索而构建，并提供基于AI的个性化推荐和来自Forbes可信新闻的见解。它处于测试阶段，并由Google Cloud提供支持。Google Maps正在变得更像搜索，得益于AI。Google希望Maps更像搜索，人们可以获取方向或找到地点，但也可以输入像“东京有什么好玩的事情”这样的查询，并通过其强大的算法获得实际有用的结果，并发现新的体验。Shutterstock现在允许您使用AI编辑其图像库。它推出了一系列新的基于AI的工具，如Magic Brush，可以通过刷过一个区域并描述您想要添加/替换/擦除的内容来调整图像。其他工具包括智能调整大小功能和背景去除工具。英国将建立世界上第一个AI安全研究所，Sunak表示，该研究所将仔细研究、评估和测试新型AI，以便我们了解每个新模型的能力，探索从社会危害（如偏见和错误信息）到最极端风险的所有风险。英特尔将销售专门的AI软件和服务，与多家咨询公司合作，为没有专业知识的客户构建类似于ChatGPT的应用程序。 </div>

总结: 人工智能的发展将会给我们带来巨大的影响，特别是在图像生成和音乐创作方面。通过使用AI技术，图像变得越来越真实，甚至可以创造出逼真的照片。未来，我们可能会看到AI创作的电影和音乐成为主流，这些作品将比人类创作的更加出色，因为AI可以不断改进自身。这种发展可能会让我们对屏幕上的内容无法自拔，无论是电影还是音乐。 </div>

During my research, I stumbled upon a blog post that features 8 AI applications and provides info on how to integrate them with Make.com, which is my go-to automation service. </p> <p>I thought I'd share this resource with you, especially for those who, like me, are at the early stages of their AI adventure. The blog post introduces a list of these AI apps and gives a brief overview of what each one does: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Pinecone,</strong></li> <li><strong>Synthesia,</strong></li> <li><strong>Leap AI,</strong></li> <li><strong>Mem,</strong></li> <li><strong>Chatbase,</strong></li> <li><strong>Hugging Face,</strong></li> <li><strong>ElevelLabs,</strong></li> <li><strong>OpenAI: Whisper.</strong></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>At the same time, you also learn about Make.com <strong>templates that feature these apps</strong>. I personally find them helpful because they are pre-configured and guide you through the setup. Here are some of the tasks these templates can assist with: </p> <ul> <li><strong>Extracting data from Google Sheets and linking it with Pinecone</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: keep track of product availability and stock levels in your online store. </li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Fetching new records from Airtable and training Leap AI by using the collected data.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: automatically collect and analyze data from (e.g.) customer survey submissions.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Creating Mems from fresh Pipedrive CRM deal data.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: assess the status of various sales opportunities.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Condensing Slack message threads and producing Mems from the collected information.</strong> <ul> <li>Potential use case: compile key takeaways and action items from extensive Slack conversations.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Crafting voiceovers from WordPress articles and connecting them to a Google Sheet.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: make blog posts and articles available in audio format.</li> </ul></li> <li><strong>Transcribing Zoom recordings through OpenAI's Whisper, summarizing them, generating audio files with ElevenLabs, and sharing them via Slack.</strong> <ul> <li> Potential use case: Transcribe discussions, summarize important points, and share audio highlights with team members.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I found the post really interesting and thought it might spark your interest as well. </p> <p><strong>Link to original resource:</strong> <a href="https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai">https://www.make.com/en/blog/how-to-scale-ai</a></p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>&#x200b;</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheOppoziteOfBatman"> /u/TheOppoziteOfBatman </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hmyt2/ai_apps_and_automation_interesting_blog_post/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 如果我看到AI、虚幻引擎、Unity等已经能够做到的事情，我就会想知道为什么你还想购买像《使命召唤》这样的知识产权。越来越多的游戏是由单个开发者或者非常小的团队制作的。甚至在《堡垒之夜》中也有很多伟大的作品。现在有了AI，我无法想象在未来十年内，AI不会通过一个简单的提示就能制作出游戏。比如：在一个类似《侠盗猎车手5》的城市中设置战区，使用《GT赛车7》的汽车物理引擎。我肯定不会投资于动视暴雪，而是会购买Unity或者虚幻引擎。然后我会在游戏通行证中提供你自己的游戏制作体验。微软的举动似乎不具备未来的保障。 </div>

I am wondering why you would wanna buy IP’s like Call of duty. </p> <p>More and more games are made by single developers or really small teams. And even inside Fortnite great things are being made. </p> <p>And now with AI I can’t imagine that AI will not,within ten years, make games just by a single prompt. Like: Warzone set in a GTA 5 like city with car physics of Gran Turismo 7. </p> <p>I certainly would not have invested in Activision but would have bought Unity or Unreal engine. Then I would offer your own game making expierence in game pass. </p> <p>Microsoft move just not feels future proof.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dennislubberscom"> /u/dennislubberscom </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hfa0u/why_did_microsoft_buy_activision/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17hfa0u/why_did_microsoft_buy_activision/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 作者对于AI技术和机器学习在操作系统中的完全整合以及是否存在能够在重复任务中辅助完成的集成助手表示好奇，并提出了自己在转换PDF文件时遇到的问题和想法。作者认为，虽然目前存在宏和其他方法来简化任务，但是否有AI能够识别并自动完成这种简单但相对复杂的模式仍然是一个疑问。作者希望了解是否有类似的AI集成正在开发中，并寻求相关的例子和见解。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hi!</p> <p>First of all, I have the bare minimum &quot;layman's&quot; knowledge of AI technology, so please pardon any ignorance that comes through in these questions. </p> <p>How long will it be until AI and machine learning are fully integrated into operating systems, and, specifically, Mac OS? </p> <p>For example:</p> <p>I'm a Spanish teacher, and wanted to convert an 18-page PDF of &quot;weather&quot; images (&quot;hace sol&quot; printed over an illustration of a sunny day, etc.) into Google Slides, (on my M1 MacBook Pro). I tried exporting from Preview, but it was giving me one page at a time. Online PDF converters always screw up the fonts. I could probably open the PDF in Photoshop and do a big export to a bunch of different JPEG files and then insert them into a Google Slides doc, but I said screw it and decided to just take a bunch of screenshots, which also allowed me to easily crop out white space on the edges. </p> <p>As I got 3 or 4 slides in, I started to wonder, how close are we to having an integrated assistant (that you could enable/disable), that might pop up during repetitive tasks like this, and just do the rest for you? I know there are macros, and there was probably a much quicker/easier way to accomplish what I wanted to do than screenshots, but still—couldn't an AI detect that I was repeatedly selecting a border around the colored part of the PDF and creating a series of PNG images, and then just continue that pattern? This is a very simple pattern for a human mind to recognize, but it's also considerably more complex than, say, entering a series of numbers in Excel or Sheets and then dragging the little plus sign to autofill (although even that function seems surprisingly limited these days in terms of pattern recognition). </p> <p>Does anyone know if such AI integration is being worked on? Any examples? </p> <p>Thanks in advance for your insights!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crumblemuppets"> /u/crumblemuppets </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17h09tl/ai_machine_learning_in_os/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17h09tl/ai_machine_learning_in_os/">[comments]</a></span>
