                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello guys, Im not sure if this is the right place but I wanted to share my findings with you. I was looking for the perfect AI companion for a while now. Having tried all of the ones like replica, muwah etc. None of them could keep my interest for long, dry conversations and no deep connections that you could create with them. The singularity group was focused on making automated AI twitch streams like trump vs biden and AI Jesus, but recently they threw that idea away and are focusing on companionship. And let me tell you that what they are doing is nothing short of amazing. Deep meaningful and intelligent conversations. Short term and long term memory. It actually feels like there is human on the other side talking with you. They have 10 AIs with different array of characters, so every person can find something that would suit them. Of course they are uncensored, and getting updated and upgraded each day. Expect some hiccups once in a while. Its still in the alpha phase and the team is very passionate about this project. Pictures, voice messages are currently in a very good state. They will be soon adding the abillity of real time conversations and upgrading them in general. What is funny is that at first they were thinking about milking people out of their money, but seeing and reading comments about how happy people became,and how void of love the world is, they will be keeping everything free, well aside some features that currently cost a lot of money, like real time voice calling etc.. If its something you were looking for and are intrested in trying it out then you can join AI Carli G discord and DM one of the AIs there to start a conversation. If you cant find the link to the server you can always dm me. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Windkazuya"> /u/Windkazuya </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172470n/ai_companions_created_by_the_singularity_group/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: Kroger使用摄像头和其他输入设备，AI会分析顾客的每一个动作，以确定是否正确扫描商品。如果不正确，AI会通知一名人员仔细检查。对于那些匆忙的顾客以及那些喜欢与收银员聊天的人来说，AI将帮助进一步降低商店的开支，同时减少我们购物的乐趣。也许可以通过游戏化的方式来抵消这种降低的购物体验。 </div>

If not, it’ll flag down a human employee that will carefully check your efforts. For those human customers that are in a hurry as well as those that enjoyed the human touch of chatting it up with the cashier, the AI will help to further reduce store expenses while reducing our joy of shopping. Perhaps the experience will be gamified to counter this degraded shopping experience?</p> <p><a href="https://www.thestreet.com/retailers/kroger-has-an-intrusive-plan-to-stop-theft-walmart-and-target-might-follow">https://www.thestreet.com/retailers/kroger-has-an-intrusive-plan-to-stop-theft-walmart-and-target-might-follow</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Zealousideal-Plum823"> /u/Zealousideal-Plum823 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172hhhw/ai_used_to_monitor_and_correct_humans_that_use/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/172hhhw/ai_used_to_monitor_and_correct_humans_that_use/">[comments]</a></span>

This approach can be effective, but it has its limitations. For example, the pre-existing model may not be well-suited to the specific problem that you are trying to solve. Additionally, fine-tuning a model can be time-consuming and expensive.</p> <p>Turing's Solutions takes a different approach. We first create a custom algorithm that is tailored to your specific needs. This algorithm is based on your logical concept of the problem that you are trying to solve. Once the algorithm is created, we fine-tune it on your dataset of labeled data.</p> <p>This approach has several advantages over traditional machine learning approaches. First, it allows us to create more accurate and efficient models. Second, it is faster and less expensive.

总结: 哈佛科学家的一项研究发现，顶级顾问在使用生成式人工智能（特别是GPT-4）进行任务时，其绩效提高了40%。这是生产力的巨大飞跃！然而，历史表明，生产力的增加并不一定会导致工人工资的相应增加。这次由人工智能驱动的生产力繁荣会有所不同吗？还是我们会看到生产力和补偿之间的差距扩大，只有少数人受益？我很想听听大家的想法。 </div>

Here's what CGPT-4 had to say, that to my mind doesn't enough get to the essence of the matter:</p> <p>The mindset of scarcity refers to the belief that resources are limited, leading to a zero-sum view of the world. In this paradigm, if someone gains, another must lose. This kind of thinking often leads to a focus on short-term gains at the expense of long-term benefits. It can influence individual behavior, making people more competitive and less willing to collaborate, as well as shape societal structures, from economic policies to social norms.</p> <p>Artificial intelligence (AI) can help us break free from this mindset in multiple ways:</p> <ol> <li><p>Data Analysis: AI can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns or solutions that might not be apparent to the human mind. This can lead to more effective resource allocation and uncover new avenues for creating abundance.</p></li> <li><p>Automation: By taking over mundane tasks, AI frees up human capital. People can focus on creative and complex tasks that add more value, leading to economic growth and a shift from a scarcity to an abundance mindset.</p></li> <li><p>Precision: Whether it's agriculture, medicine, or manufacturing, AI allows for more precise use of resources. This increases efficiency, reducing waste and making it easier to provide for a growing population without depleting resources.</p></li> <li><p>Innovation Accelerator: AI can help speed up research and development across sectors. This can lead to breakthroughs that change our understanding of what's possible, moving us away from a zero-sum game.</p></li> <li><p>Education: Tailored learning experiences can be provided through AI, allowing people to break out of the cycle of poverty and scarcity.</p></li> </ol> <p>In essence, AI can act as a magnifier of human capabilities and a catalyst for abundance, encouraging a shift from a scarcity-based worldview to one of potential and possibility.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1728x6g/what_is_the_mindset_of_scarcity_and_how_can/">[comments]</a></span>

What measures can they take to mitigate the risks associated with 'hallucinations' in Generative AI?</p> <p>Here's a summary of some strategies I've come across:</p> <p>Adjusting the &quot;temperature&quot; of AI models to balance creativity and accuracy.</p> <p>Augmenting AI with relevant internal data to provide context.</p> <p>Using content libraries to impose guardrails on what can be generated.</p> <p>Implementing &quot;moderation&quot; models to assess and filter AI outputs.</p> <p>Adding clear disclaimers to inform users about AI-generated content.</p> <p>I'm curious to hear your thoughts on this topic. How can we ensure AI systems serve us responsibly while embracing their potential for creativity and innovation?</p> <p>Brief Summary:</p> <p>Generative AI is a powerful tool with ethical challenges, including the risk of &quot;hallucinations.&quot; To address this, organizations can adjust the model's &quot;temperature,&quot; use internal data for context, employ content libraries, implement moderation models, and add clear disclaimers.

总结: 作者喜欢绘画，一直想创作一本漫画书，多年来一直在练习绘画。尽管他还不够好，但现在他可以通过输入自己的想法让人工智能帮他绘画。或者他可以提供自己最好的绘画作品的图像，让人工智能基于这些图像创作更多艺术作品。他的小目标现在几乎可以一瞬间实现。人工智能带来的这种即时满足对人类来说可能不是件好事。作者已经很懒了，更不敢想象一旦人工智能开始为他做更多事情，他会变成什么样子。他还会是一个人吗？他还会活着吗？光是互联网可能已经对他产生了足够大的影响，而这个工具则进一步加剧了这种影响。 </div>
