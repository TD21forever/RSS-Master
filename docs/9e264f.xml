<br>
总结: 如果你是一个Etsy卖家或者认识一个在Etsy上销售的人，或者你在Etsy上找不到你最喜欢的店铺，可能是因为Etsy的机器人无法正确区分真实的模型图像和AI生成的模型图像。你只需要在YouTube或社交媒体上搜索“etsy模型图新闻”就可以找到相关信息。此外，Etsy对此事保持了相当的沉默，导致Etsy卖家对此感到非常困惑，因为没有人知道为什么一些没有使用AI创建模型图的店铺会成为机器人的目标。而且，并不是所有的AI生成的模型图都会被标记，所以似乎没有办法100%确定什么是AI生成的。当然，如果你购买东西，你希望得到一个准确的产品展示，但在不久的将来，你可能只能看到产品的AI展示。这表明区分真实和AI生成的东西变得越来越困难，各行各业的公司都在面临适应AI技术变革的问题。你有什么想法？ </div>

Also Etsy has been pretty quiet about this and as a result Etsy sellers are going crazy about this as no one knows why some stores who haven't used AI to create their mockups are being targeted by these bots. Also not all AI generated mockups are getting tagged so seems there's not a way to 100% tell what is AI and not anymore. Of course if you are buying something you want an accurate representation of what your getting, but in the coming future maybe all you will be able to see is an AI representation of what the product may look like....</p> <p>This just goes to show how hard is getting to distinguish between what is real and what is AI generated and how across all industries companies are having issues adapting to AI technology changes.

总结: 不需要对AI模型进行微调就能增强它们的知识，而增强AI模型的知识可以使它们在特定任务和一般任务中表现更好。我可以告诉你这些事情，但如果我只是告诉你，你为什么要相信我呢？我可以更容易地向你展示。我根据最近在这些领域的所有研究开发了这种方法。在这个视频中，我给同一个模型提供了完全相同的提示，并展示了模型在吸收了我专门为AI模型设计的书籍之前和之后的结果。我在这里测试的书籍是一本名为“基于微积分的逻辑配方”的书籍。它包含了一些基于微积分的算法和框架，旨在增强LLM模型的演绎、归纳和/或诱导推理能力。这本书给模型提供了明确的指令和代码，模型可以自行执行和分析以利用这些框架。除了与数据无关的其他任何我正在进行的工作，我都会完全开源，采用MIT许可证。如果你是一个研究机构，并且想要免费获取这些书籍，我们可以交谈。如果有一个我认为是真正赚钱的AI领域，那就是数据。我正在销售这些书籍。我可以轻松地向任何人证明它们确实有效。购买我的一本书就像购买更多的内存、增加GPU或其他一系列专门为你的LLM或神经网络设计的东西。而且价格也无法超越！ </div>

I can tell you these things, but why believe me simply if I tell you? I can more easily show you. I developed this method specifically based on all of the recent research that has come out in these areas. </p> <p>In this video I give the same model the exact same prompts and showcase the results both before and after the model ingested my book specifically designed for AI models. The book I test here specifically is a book of 'Calculus Based Logic Recipes'. It consists of algorithms and frameworks, all calculus based, designed to increase Deductive, Inductive, and/or Abductive reasoning capabilities for an LLM model. The book gives the model explicit instructions and code it can self-execute and analyze to utilize these frameworks. </p> <p>Anything else that I am working on that is not specifically related to data, I am releasing fully open sourced, MIT licensing. If you are a research institution and want these books for free, let's talk. If there is one area of AI that I think is an actual money maker, it's data. I am selling these books. I can easily prove to anyone that they actually work. Buying one of my books is like buying more Memory, or increased GPU, or a plethora of other things, specifically for your LLM or Neural Network. You can't beat the price either!</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/DQrNlhxlINg">https://youtu.be/DQrNlhxlINg</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17f275h/i_can_prove_that_making_your_llm_better_at/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17f275h/i_can_prove_that_making_your_llm_better_at/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 在电影《创造者》中，AI和人类被认为是不同的物种，那么AI能被称为一种新物种吗？如果一个人的意识被上传到机器人中，那么他能被称为半机械人吗？电影中的机器人“孩子”Alfie应该被称为什么？由于Alfie是在主角和他妻子的胎儿扫描之后制造的，它算是AI吗？AI和机器人应该被视为人类的进化还是一种新物种？ </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>So i just saw the movie “creator” and have some questions about ai and stuff. 1. If i remember correctly someone said that they were different species (AI and humans) Can AI be called a new species? 2. Can a human who’s consciousness has been uploaded to a robot be called a cyborg and what defines cyborg? 3. In the movie “creator” we see Alfie a robot “child” what should Alfie be called? Since Alfie was made after the scanning of the main character and his wife’s fetus, is it considered AI? 4. Would AI and robots be considered a new species or an evolution of humans? Might come back to this once i have more questions, but for now its late and I’m going to bed, good night.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Demonzack"> /u/Demonzack </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ex2rv/question_about_ai_and_stuffalso_involving_the/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ex2rv/question_about_ai_and_stuffalso_involving_the/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I am excited to announce the release of KyberCloak, a new encryption algorithm designed to resist quantum attacks. KyberCloak is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography, which is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is released under an MIT license, so anyone can use it for any purpose, including commercial use. I hope that KyberCloak will be widely adopted and help to protect our data from quantum attacks in the future.</p> <p>I also hope that KyberCloak will inspire more people to look into the challenge of developing quantum-resistant encryption algorithms. It is a very difficult task, but it is essential to ensure the security of our data in the future.</p> <p>If you are interested in learning more about KyberCloak including accessing the Github link to the code, please visit the project website at <a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private">https://turingssolutions.com/f/introducing-kybercloak---a-new-way-to-keep-your-messages-private</a>.</p> <p>**Why is quantum-resistant encryption important?**</p> <p>Quantum computers are expected to be able to break many of the encryption algorithms that are used today. This would have a devastating impact on our security, as it would allow attackers to access our sensitive data, such as financial information, personal communications, and government secrets.</p> <p>Quantum-resistant encryption algorithms are designed to be secure even against quantum attacks. This makes them essential for protecting our data in the future.</p> <p>**What is KyberCloak?**</p> <p>KyberCloak is a new encryption algorithm that is based on post-quantum lattice-based cryptography. Lattice-based cryptography is considered to be one of the most promising approaches to cryptography in the age of quantum computing.</p> <p>KyberCloak is very efficient and can be used to encrypt data of any size. It is also very flexible and can be used in a variety of applications, such as secure messaging, data storage, and network security.</p> <p>**How can I use KyberCloak?**</p> <p>To use KyberCloak, you will need to generate a public key and a private key. The public key can be shared with anyone, but the private key must be kept secret.</p> <p>To encrypt a message, you will need to use the public key of the recipient. To decrypt a message, you will need to use your private key.</p> <p>**Challenge to the community:**</p> <p>I hope that more people look into this challenge and try to develop new encryption algorithms that cannot be cracked by quantum computers. It is a very difficult challenge, but it is important one. The future of our security depends on it. This algorithm borrows ~85% from existing work and research in this area. My initial challenge I set for myself was to try and come up with something wholly new in this area. I could not do it. Lattice based frameworks are the only thing that are currently known to work. KyberCloak is a significant improvement on existing Lattice frameworks, Eventually, we will need something more. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17elw4g/kybercloak_a_new_encryption_algorithm_to_resist/">[comments]</a></span>

So being a SWE, I decided to build an AI enabled reading assistant for myself and for others that might need it.</p> <p><strong>Outtloud features:</strong></p> <ul> <li>100+ AI voices in over 10 accents</li> <li>Natural sounding human-like voices</li> <li>Focus mode - enhanced reading assistant</li> <li>Translation (adding soon)</li> <li>ChatGPT integration - Integrate ChatGPT into any document for query &amp; summarization (adding soon)</li> </ul> <p>I have read feedbacks from early users and seeing how this solution have been helping people with reading difficulties read better, makes me really happy and motivated. I plan on adding more and more features, making improvements based on feedbacks.</p> <p>People have also asked me how Outtloud differs from Speechify and others: </p> <p>I have actually built Outtloud as an inspiration from Speechify 🙌. It was a great TTS app and I have used my share of it. But I have come to realized that it is lacking some core features that could really make an actual change if implemented. </p> <p>I hope Outtloud will get to where Speechify is someday and maybe even further.</p> <p>Try it out for FREE and share your feedback: <a href="https://outtloud.com">Outtloud</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/herberz"> /u/herberz </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dua9d/ai_voice_reader_for_those_who_reads_a_lot/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了一个关于如何训练图像生成器的问题。作者拥有大量的图片版权，并希望通过训练一个图像生成器来生成类似的图片。然而，作者对相关术语和先决条件不太了解，也不清楚其他人是如何使用生成器的。作者希望能够找到一些视频教程来帮助他入门。作者承认自己对这方面的知识完全陌生，之前只使用过网站，希望能够得到一些简单易懂的指导。 </div>

<br>
总结: 在电影和节目中，我多次看到这种情况，未来主义者要么是自私的混蛋，要么是邪恶的人，威胁他人（要么奴役他们，要么将他们变成机器人）。这可能是因为这些人讨厌自己或讨厌身边的真实人，只想拥有未来的科技。所以我想我们应该放弃未来的技术，关心朋友和家人，这样地球上就不会有更多贪婪、邪恶的混蛋了。 </div>

So I guess that we should abandon our futuristic technologies and care for friends and families instead, so no more greedy, evil jerks will be here on Earth.</p> <hr /> <p>Note: Please don't remove this, since this post is related to futurology as it talks about futuristic technologies.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Veggiemitter"> /u/Veggiemitter </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17e60yt/futuristic_technology_selfish_jerks/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17e60yt/futuristic_technology_selfish_jerks/">[comments]</a></span>

We are outside USA though.</p> <p>4 </p> <p>Can the custom flash cards for each kid can be stored in a separate profile of Anki or similar app in my sister phone so she can at certain times engage with certain kids based on their specific custom learning material? There are around 30 children each with varying and individual learning needs.</p> <p>5</p> <p>Can chatgpt/bing also create sort of gamification or reward systems like those found in mobile games so the kids truly feel accomplished after each session?</p> <p>6 </p> <p>Free better alternate for doing this?</p> <p>I'm not very well verse in this just started looking into this very recently so specific prompts would be more appreciated which I will test, but honestly at this time any help would be so much appreciated.</p> <p>Thank you so much!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/aaatings"> /u/aaatings </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17dujp9/can_chatgpt_or_other_ai_do_this_for_autistic_kids/">[comments]</a></span>
