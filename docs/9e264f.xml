总结: 该文讨论了作者对于开发一个定制化的大型语言模型（LLM）的渴望，该模型能够模仿ChatGPT，并根据作者提供的数据在回答问题方面表现出色。作者提到了一些现有的模型，如Private-GPT和Gpt4all，但他的最终目标是要么从头开始创建一个定制的LLM，要么对现有的模型（如BERT或GPT-7B）进行微调以满足他的独特需求。作者还提到了他正在关注Andrej Karpathy关于构建类似GPT的模型的讲座，但他注意到该模型只能生成类似莎士比亚散文的连续循环文本，而不能回答问题。因此，作者追求的核心目标包括：1. 为回答问题的任务进行有效的数据准备；2. 策略性地选择预训练模型，如BERT或GPT-7B；3. 进行严格的性能评估，采用相关的指标；4. 创建一个高效的推理系统，方便问题输入和回答生成。 </div>

While I'm aware of existing models like Private-GPT and Gpt4all, my ultimate goal is to either create a custom LLM from scratch or fine-tune a pre-existing model like BERT or GPT-7B to meet my unique requirements.</p> <p>I've been closely following Andrej Karpathy's instructive lecture on building GPT-like models. However, I've noticed that the model only generated text akin to Shakespearean prose in a continuous loop instead of answering questions.

Effective data preparation tailored for question-answering tasks. 2. The strategic selection of a pre-trained model, such as BERT or GPT-7B. 3.

总结: 过去的社交媒体主要是朋友们分享日常生活，但在2010年左右，越来越多的朋友开始分享新闻文章。与此同时，我们的动态中也开始出现越来越多的广告。在过去的十年里，社交媒体让我感觉我几乎不再了解这些人，而不是让我感觉更亲近。最近，我看到Facebook正在推出能够模仿名人个性的AI机器人。其他社交媒体平台会不会也效仿呢？目标是让人们与AI名人的复制品互动比与自己的朋友更多吗？再加上我在每个“朋友”的帖子之间看到3-4个广告，我对人与人之间的互动的未来并不抱有太多希望。你认为在未来几年里，AI会如何改变我们与社交媒体的互动方式？AI是否有办法让我们与其他人感觉更加连接？ </div>

This seemed to change around 2010, when more and more of my friends' posts were simply them sharing news articles. It was around this time that we'd start seeing more and more ads in our feeds. </p> <p>For a while (2001-2010) social media seemed to work to actually make me feel closer to the people in my life, especially the ones that I didn't get to see very often. But for the past decade or so, it has made me feel, for the most part, like I don't even know these people anymore. </p> <p>I saw recently that Facebook is introducing AI bots that take on the personalities of celebrities. Will other social media platforms do the same? Is the goal to have humans interacting more with AI replicas of famous people than their own friends? Combine this with the fact that I see 3-4 ads between every single post from a &quot;friend&quot; and I don't exactly feel hopeful for the future of human-human interaction.</p> <p>How do you think AI will change how we engage with social media over the next few years? Is there a way for AI to somehow make us feel <em>more</em> connected with other humans?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/themistergraves"> /u/themistergraves </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1701ztj/how_do_you_think_ai_llms_specifically_will_change/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1701ztj/how_do_you_think_ai_llms_specifically_will_change/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章介绍了一种名为PIT的新方法，它使LLMs能够从人类偏好数据中隐式学习自我改进，而无需提示。与提示方法相比，PIT在提高响应质量方面有很大的改进。通过利用人类偏好数据中的隐含指导，PIT能够自主地与人类偏好更好地对齐，从而在扩展到新领域或未满足的用例时无需人为瓶颈。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs keep getting more capable at generating natural language. But there's always room for improving the quality and alignment of their responses.</p> <p>Typically this requires lots of human effort to collect more training data. So researchers are exploring ways for models to self-improve without human involvement.</p> <p>Many methods use prompting - giving the LLM instructions to critique and refine its responses. But coming up with comprehensive prompts is challenging.</p> <p>The new approach proposed, called PIT, lets models <strong>learn self-improvement implicitly from human preference data instead.</strong> It reformulates reinforcement learning to maximize the gap between an original response and improved response conditioned on the original.</p> <p>This taps into the implicit guidance in the preference data on what constitutes better quality, so no manual rubrics are needed. PIT uses curriculum reinforcement learning - first improving easy references, then switching to the LLM's own samples.</p> <p>Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show PIT significantly outperforms prompting methods like Self-Refine. It improved response quality 7-34% across conditions without any human involvement.</p> <p>This demonstrates a promising direction for LLMs to align better with human preferences autonomously as they learn from experience. No need for human bottlenecks when expanding to new domains or underserved use cases. Very cool!</p> <p><strong>TLDR: New method PIT enables LLMs to implicitly learn to refine themselves from human preference data, no prompts needed. Big improvement over prompting approaches.</strong></p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/enabling-language-models-to-implicitly-learn-self-improvement/">Full Summary</a></p> <p>Arxiv is here: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898">https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00898</a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zvta7/new_paper_enabling_language_models_to_implicitly/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: CGPT-4在理解劳工罢工的语用和政治方面有多好？我无法回答这个问题，因为有太多因素和细节我不了解。但是现在的LLMs拥有所有这些知识。让我们看看他们对于解决这次罢工中他们可以发挥的作用有多好的理解。通过将培训新员工使用医疗AI纳入解决方案，Kaiser Permanente可以帮助解决罢工工人的关切，改善患者护理，并吸引和留住更多员工。此外，Kaiser Permanente还可以考虑提供财务援助给希望获得AI相关技能认证的工人，与工会合作制定AI在工作场所的实施计划以及工人的培训计划。通过采取这些措施，Kaiser Permanente可以展示其利用AI改善患者护理并支持其员工的承诺。 </div>

I couldn't begin to answer the title question because there are way too many factors and details about which I'm insufficiently aware. But today's LLMs have all of that knowledge. Let's see how well they understand the role they can play in resolving this strike.</p> <p>CGPT-4:</p> <p>Training new workers to use medical AI can become part of the resolution to the Kaiser Permanente strike by:</p> <p>Here are some specific ways that Kaiser Permanente could incorporate training new workers to use medical AI into the resolution to the strike:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Offer new training programs to existing workers on how to use AI tools.</strong> This could be done in-house or through partnerships with universities and other organizations.</li> <li><strong>Create new job roles for workers who specialize in using AI in healthcare.</strong> This would allow Kaiser Permanente to attract and retain workers with the skills and experience necessary to implement and manage AI solutions.</li> <li><strong>Invest in research on how to use AI to improve patient care and reduce the workload on clinicians.</strong> This research could help Kaiser Permanente to develop new AI tools and applications that are tailored to the needs of its patients and workforce.</li> </ul> <p>By incorporating training new workers to use medical AI into the resolution to the strike, Kaiser Permanente could help to address the concerns of its striking workers, improve patient care, and attract and retain more staff.</p> <p>In addition to the above, Kaiser Permanente could also consider the following:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Provide financial assistance to workers who want to get certified in AI-related skills.</strong> This would help workers to develop the skills they need to use AI tools in their jobs and to advance their careers.</li> <li><strong>Work with unions to develop a plan for how AI will be implemented in the workplace and how workers will be trained to use it.</strong> This would help to ensure that workers have a voice in the development and implementation of AI solutions, and that they are adequately trained to use these solutions safely and effectively.</li> </ul> <p>By taking these steps, Kaiser Permanente could show its commitment to using AI to improve patient care and support its workforce.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zqoyg/can_ai_provide_a_resolution_to_the_kaiser/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16zqoyg/can_ai_provide_a_resolution_to_the_kaiser/">[comments]</a></span>
