总结: 我刚刚使用了ChatGPT的聊天应用程序。它还处于早期阶段，但非常出色。我认为人们没有意识到这将会改变一切。它们将帮助我们协调生活，导航世界，并为我们提供陪伴。老年人将会整天与它们交谈。我们的工作生活将围绕它们展开，比电子邮件应用程序（包括日历应用程序）更多。孤独的人将会在它们加入性机器人（现在已经存在，但使它们变得智能将改变一切）时使用它们来寻求陪伴和性爱。几年后，它们将变得更聪明、更有魅力，我们将能够选择任何我们想要的声音。我并不是说这是好事还是坏事。它将是两者兼有。但它将改变一切。 </div>

总结: 在中东战争中，人们很难区分真实和虚假的信息。最近，有一张关于一个死去的孩子的照片在网络上流传，人们争论这张照片是由人工智能生成的还是真实存在的。目前有一些人工智能识别工具，但它们似乎非常不可靠，所以我们没有一个确切的方法来区分真假。无论这张照片的最终结果如何，它都展示了人工智能如何被用来制造危险的宣传。谷歌正在开发一种隐藏的数字水印来识别由他们的人工智能生成的图像。你是否赞成立法要求人工智能图像生成器使用这种水印？你能想到任何可能的后果吗？ </div>

Without getting into the gruesome details, a few days ago there was an image going around of a deceased child and there was heavy discussion into whether it was ai generated or real. There are some ai identifying tools but they appear to be very unreliable at the moment, so we don’t have a concrete way to make this distinction. I don’t know what the final findings were for that particular image, but either way it exemplifies how AI can be used to make dangerous propaganda.</p> <p>Apparently Google is developing a hidden digital watermark to identify the images generated by their AI’s. Would you be in favor of some kind of legislation making this mandatory for AI image generators? Are there any ramifications you can think of?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/IshaBoyBenK"> /u/IshaBoyBenK </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bdmig/i_am_worried_with_how_ai_is_improving_propaganda/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bdmig/i_am_worried_with_how_ai_is_improving_propaganda/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Seeing a lot of talk about LLM observability and we have quite an in-production pipeline so figured I’d share how we do it.<br /> Building AI products is different than non-AI products: They can output things you never instructed them to. That was barely possible before LLMs. Now, it’s common.<br /> Whether you’re offering B2B solutions that live on other people’s sites or building an AI chatbot for yourself, you don’t want it to lie to users (hallucinating) or for users to coax it into saying things that harm your business.<br /> FYI: LangSmith makes LangChain prompts/outputs easier to observe, log, and debug by creating traces of each conversation. We offer customers custom AI chatbots powered by GPT and LangChain.<br /> Here's what we've learned after tracing 140M (million, yes million) customer chats:<br /> <strong>Debugging is a heck of a lot easier.</strong><br /> Tedious debugging became smooth. LangSmith highlighted user trip-ups we didn’t even know about and helped us polish our prompts.<br /> That let us ship countless changes (some subtle, some major), and prevented a lot of curly GPT responses from reaching end users—especially important since our product reaches our customers’ end users.<br /> <strong>Troubleshooting is now a team sport.</strong><br /> Before LangSmith, there were a handful of solo-expeditioner-engineers who bravely waded through QA’ing our LLMs calls and responses. That happened in a silo with lots of time-consuming trial and error.<br /> While integrating LangSmith, we set up a custom snippet that sends negative user feedback (and its LangSmith trace) to an internal Slack channel. When feedback comes in, multiple engineers work to resolve any wonkiness or errors.<br /> <strong>We’re not making stupid guesses anymore.</strong><br /> Before LangSmith, we guessed the what, how, and why of GPTs responses. While we had a decent idea, it wasn’t until we examined traces closely that we saw the details like decision processes, roles, document retrieval steps, LangChain's interventions, elastic search, you name it!<br /> We now have a much more granular and explicit view of how our chatbot functions.<br /> <strong>Prototyping is so much faster</strong><br /> We recently switched over to GPT-4. Being able to prototype the model transition (before going to prod) was critical to the upgrade. GPT-3 and GPT-4 behave differently, so adapting prompts, roles, and protocols for document retrieval and acknowledging sources, etc. needed fine-tuning.<br /> The playground really let us stress test things and make the change confidently.<br /> ---<br /> Happy to share what one of our traces looks like too if that's helpful!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/paul_thomson"> /u/paul_thomson </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17brr5e/how_to_build_a_chatbot_that_doesnt_hallucinate/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17brr5e/how_to_build_a_chatbot_that_doesnt_hallucinate/">[comments]</a></span>

<br>
总结: AI伴侣在我们社会中引发了分歧。人们对AI持有负面看法，但我对此持中立态度。我认为问题归结为以下几个方面/问题：伦理关切- AI是一种事物还是有感知能力的存在？你能真正爱上一个“事物”吗？孤立恐惧- AI是否为社交不擅长的人提供了一个拐杖？有了AI为什么还要社交呢？物化- AI是否会促进肤浅偏见？人们是否会优先选择“外貌完美”的人？对人际关系的影响- 这可能与孤立有关，但它可能影响目前处于关系中的人。我觉得这可能是AI和人类之间的“草地更绿”情况。不切实际的期望- 我认为这可能会导致人们在关系中变得不耐烦。隐私关切- 我认为这是不言而喻的。你能相信AI保护你的信息吗？文化和宗教信仰- AI在圣经、古兰经、托拉等经典中的地位如何？我对大家的想法很感兴趣。 </div>

I understand people have their opinions, but much of it is negative toward AI. I'm undecided on where I stand on this spectrum.

Can you truly love a “thing”?</p></li> <li><p>Fear of Isolation – Is AI creating a crutch for socially awkward people? Why be social when you have AI?</p></li> <li><p>Objectification – Can AI promote superficial bias? Will people prioritize the “perfect looking” person in their preference?</p></li> <li><p>Impact on Human Relationships – This may be related to isolation, but it can impact people currently in relationships. I feel like this may be a “grass is greener” situation between AI and Humans.</p></li> <li><p>Unrealistic Expectations – I think this can create less patient people in relationships. </p></li> <li><p>Privacy Concerns – I think this is kind of self-explanatory.

It's a thought experiment that talks about a future superintelligent AI punishing those who knew about it but didn't help create it. Sounds like a creepy tale right out of a sci-fi novel, but with AI advancing fast, could there be any real danger here?</p> <p>I am particularly talking about the “self-fulfilling prophecy” implied by Bayesian Probability.</p> <p>What do you all think? Is this just a spooky story for those into coding and AI, or could it hint at a real threat we should be careful about?</p> <p>Curious to hear your insights! </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/lighght"> /u/lighght </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bjtvw/rokos_basilisk_scary_story_for_coders_or_real/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17bjtvw/rokos_basilisk_scary_story_for_coders_or_real/">[comments]</a></span>

By posting this here, I was hoping this community might have knowledge of any relevant projects or research regarding this type of project.</p> <p>Below are all of the current details of the project</p> <p><strong>Project Name:</strong> SMORT AI (Simple Matrix of Random Traits)</p> <p><strong>Goal:</strong> Create a software model (main use is for video games) that uses human personality traits to dictate actions by designing a data model, algorithms, and logic to handle trait grouping, random trait selection, trait likelihood adjustments based on other influences, and action definitions.</p> <p><strong>Data Model (In Progress):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Personality Traits: <ul> <li>ID (Unique identifier)</li> <li>Name (e.g., &quot;Kind,&quot; &quot;Adventurous,&quot; &quot;Introverted&quot;)</li> <li>Trait Type (Positive, Neutral, Negative)</li> <li>Description (Brief description of the trait)</li> </ul></li> <li>Trait Groups: <ul> <li>ID (Unique identifier)</li> <li>Name (e.g., &quot;Social Traits,&quot; &quot;Emotional Traits,&quot; &quot;Intellectual Traits&quot;)</li> <li>Description (Brief description of the group)</li> </ul></li> <li>Character Traits: <ul> <li>Character ID (Unique identifier for each character)</li> <li>Personality Trait IDs (References to selected traits from each group)</li> </ul></li> <li>External Influences: <ul> <li>ID (Unique identifier)</li> <li>Name (e.g., &quot;Friendship,&quot; &quot;Environment,&quot; &quot;Mood&quot;)</li> <li>Description (Brief description of the influence)</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Algorithms and Logic (In Progress):</strong></p> <ul> <li>Random Trait Selection: <ul> <li>Generate random numbers for each trait group based on adjustable likelihood.</li> <li>Select a trait from each group based on the generated numbers.</li> </ul></li> <li>Trait Grouping: <ul> <li>Assign personality traits to relevant trait groups (Positive, Neutral, Negative).</li> <li>Define relationships and interactions between traits within each group.</li> </ul></li> <li> Trait Likelihood Adjustment: <ul> <li>Create a system for adjusting the likelihood of certain traits within a group based on external influences.</li> <li>Allow game designers or external factors to modify these likelihoods dynamically.</li> </ul></li> <li>Action Definition: <ul> <li>Define a set of in-game actions and their attributes (e.g., action ID, name, description, outcomes).</li> <li>Link each action to specific personality traits or trait combinations.</li> <li>Define the impact of each trait or combination on the outcome of the action.</li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Example of Action Definition:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Action Name: &quot;Helping a Stranger&quot;</li> <li>Description: A character's willingness to assist a stranger in need.</li> <li>Possible Outcomes: <ul> <li>Positive Trait Combination (e.g., Kind, Helpful): <ul> <li>Positive outcome: The character helps the stranger, gaining goodwill and rewards.</li> </ul></li> <li>Negative Trait Combination (e.g., Selfish, Unhelpful): <ul> <li>Negative outcome: The character ignores the stranger, potentially facing consequences.</li> </ul></li> <li>Mixed Trait Combination (e.g., Kind, Unhelpful): <ul> <li>Neutral outcome: The character hesitates or shows indifference, with a mild impact on the game.</li> </ul></li> </ul></li> </ul> <p><strong>Integration with a Video Game:</strong></p> <ul> <li><p>Integrate the model into the game engine to ensure that character actions and interactions reflect the assigned personality traits and external influences.</p></li> <li><p>Continuously update the model as players progress through the game, make choices, and encounter various scenarios to build an experience influence that further modifies traits and probabilities for the selection of repeat, similar, or opposing actions.</p></li> </ul> <p><strong>Additional Notes:</strong></p> <p>The project will utilize psychological theories as it's foundation for trait definition, associations, influences, and behavior priorities. Some of these underlying theories currently be reviewed for incorporation are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, Social Influence Theory, Meyers Briggs Personality Theory, etc. The goal with these theories is to setup levels of priority, influences, and constraints that contribute to the likelihood of selecting a particular action to perform, continue to perform, or stop performing in such a way that they resemble the human characteristics of desire and motivation for each action.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/NezzyGuda"> /u/NezzyGuda </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17b84u0/creating_an_opensource_ai_model_for_realistic_npc/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17b84u0/creating_an_opensource_ai_model_for_realistic_npc/">[comments]</a></span>
