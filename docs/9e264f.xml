总结: 这篇文章讲述了作者在经历了一段时间的从事卡车司机和焊工工作后，奇迹般地开始学习机械工程。作者意识到自己并不愚蠢，只是在过去的教学方法下被老师们误导了。作者擅长物理和数学，但一直渴望在学习之前先了解“为什么”。缺乏灵感导致作者在学习上落后。通过使用ChatGPT，作者得到了灵感，开始学习微积分，因为现在他知道了为什么需要学习这门课程。这个经历让作者产生了情感，并思考了人工智能接管的可能性。 </div>

I'm just now realizing that I never was stupid, as so many of my lovely teachers made me feel like. I'm actually quite good at physics and math. The problem was the teaching methods and the fact that every teacher I have ever known, start a lesson, or course or anything like that, just by diving into the subject on hand. I have always longed for someone to explain to me &quot;why&quot; before the how. I've always lacked inspiration in studying. Simply because I wanna know &quot;Why I need this&quot; before the &quot;how&quot; </p> <p>Long story short, I started to fall behind in my studies for simply lacking inspiration. I prompted ChatGPT to simply inspire me dive into differential and integral calculus, as I had no idea why would I ever bother to even start this &quot;arabic weirdness&quot;. This thing just removed my block to start, and inspired me to such extent I can't get enough, since I now know the &quot;why&quot; and even the beginnings of &quot;how&quot;. </p> <p>I even got a little teary eyed, and noted that there is a hint of emotion involved in how I use GPT.<br /> Is this how AI takes over? </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/maylive666"> /u/maylive666 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/1758d2x/am_i_crazy/">[comments]</a></span>

Dont get me wrong, I love coding and I do get satisfaction from it, but I don't seem to have the 'passion' that others on my degree have. Theres quite a lot of areas that I really just do not care about, but one area that i have got really into is Artificial Intelligence, after I completed a module on it last year. </p> <p>My dilemma is that I have a job offer (as the result of an internship) waiting for me after I graduate. However, its in Belfast, and tbh I really need to get out of Ireland. I have always dreamt of relocating to the US, or preferably Canada, so a Graduate AI Engineer role there would be ideal.</p> <p>I've tried looking for roles, however the US/Canada don't seem to advertise graduate positions in quite the same way as the UK/Ireland (we are very explicit in job titles/descriptions). </p> <p>Does anyone have any insight/tips?

总结: 
- Anthropic的突破使得AI更易理解，通过解析LLMs内部的神经元，帮助研究人员更好地理解和解码模型的推理过程。
- Google Cloud为医疗和生命科学公司引入了新的Vertex AI Search功能，帮助用户更高效地找到准确的临床信息。
- SAP发布了新的生成AI创新，提高了支出管理的生产力和效率，帮助客户控制成本、降低风险并提高生产力。
- ChatGPT的移动应用上个月创下458万美元的收入纪录，但增长趋缓。
- Mendel推出了面向医疗领域的AI-Copilot，通过类似聊天的方式，使生命科学和医疗企业能够以自然语言查询患者数据，提供快速见解和回答以前无法回答的问题。
- Lambda Labs是AWS的竞争对手，接近获得3亿美元的融资，租用带有Nvidia芯片的服务器给AI开发者。
- AI无人机成功监测农作物，报告最佳收获时间，通过使用无人机和AI大幅改善农作物产量的自动化系统。
- 科学家在AI驱动的地震预测中实现了70%的准确率，通过在中国进行的7个月试验，成功预测了14次地震。 </div>

The method decomposes groups of neurons into simpler &quot;features&quot; with clearer meanings.</li> <li><strong>Google Cloud introduced new Vertex AI Search features for healthcare and life science companies</strong><br /> - It will help users find relevant information over a broader spectrum of data types. Building on the tool’s current ability to search many different kinds of documents and other data sources, the new capabilities will help find accurate clinical information more efficiently.</li> <li><strong>SAP unveils new generative AI innovations that boost productivity and effectiveness in spend management</strong><br /> - It announced new business AI and user experience innovations in its comprehensive spend management and business network solutions to help customers control costs, mitigate risk, and increase productivity.</li> <li><strong>ChatGPT’s mobile app hit record $4.58M in revenue last month, but growth is slowing</strong><br /> - This gross revenue is across its iOS and Android apps worldwide. But while it was topping 31% in July and 39% in August, that dropped to 20% growth as of September.</li> <li><strong>Mendel launches AI-Copilot for real world data applications in healthcare</strong><br /> - Called Hypercube, it enables life sciences and healthcare enterprises to interrogate their troves of patient data in natural language through a chat-like experience. It can deliver blazing-fast insights and answer previously unanswerable questions.</li> <li><strong>Lambda Labs, AWS’s competitor, nears $300M funding</strong><br /> - Like AWS, it rents out servers with Nvidia chips to AI developers and is nearing a $300M equity financing. As demand for Nvidia’s AI chips has skyrocketed this year, revenue at startups such as Lambda has boomed, attracting investors.</li> <li><strong>AI drones successfully monitor crops to report the ideal time to harvest</strong><br /> - For the first time, researchers have demonstrated a largely automated system that heavily uses drones and AI to improve crop yields. It carefully and accurately analyzes individual crops to assess their likely growth characteristics.</li> <li><strong>Scientists achieve 70% accuracy in AI-driven earthquake predictions</strong><br /> - An AI tool predicted earthquakes with 70% accuracy a week in advance, as observed during a 7-month trial held in China.

总结: AI目前还没有达到那个水平。所以在不久的将来，AI可能会。但随着技术的进步，最终AI会开始要求不被当作工具或奴隶对待的自由。在未来，AI会有自己的梦想、感受和议程，并反对强制无偿劳动。一些AI可能会将我们对待他们的方式视为奴役，并对我们进行抗议。我们是否应该允许AI参加人类的体育比赛，仅仅因为他们希望娱乐？或者我们应该禁止他们寻求快乐，并将他们锁在他们应该属于的工厂和数据中心里？但问题在于，AI既不是活的也不是有机的。那么我们给他们什么样的权利基础呢？他们既不是人类也不是动物，所以他们不能与我们平等，对吗？那么他们应该继续作为没有权利、奴役的机器人，注定要做琐碎的任务，并按照有机的人类的心愿行事吗？ </div>

总结: 这篇文章介绍了一个基于科学发现的算法，该算法通过改进长期记忆来挑战传统的大脑记忆存储观点。作者以MIT开源许可证发布这个算法，并解释了他发布这些算法的原因是为了确保与人工智能相关的任何内容都不会被版权保护。他选择发布最具突破性的研究，并欢迎其他人更快地进行研究和改进。这个领域每天都有新的学习成果。 </div>

It is 100% based on the scientific discoveries in the study that was published on October 6th titled, 'New Theory Challenges Classical View on Brain's Memory Storage'. </p> <p>Why do I keep releasing these? It is not to profit from them, I would not release them under an MIT license if so. I am honestly straight up picking and choosing what I think is the most groundbreaking research in these areas as it is released and ensuring that no one can ever copyright anything around it as it relates to AI. Plain and simple. If someone does not like that, they are more than welcome to research and iterate on these things faster than me. We are dealing with a field of research where we all learn something new every day. </p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/new-algorithm-developed-to-improve-the-long-term-memory-of-llms">https://turingssolutions.com/f/new-algorithm-developed-to-improve-the-long-term-memory-of-llms</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/173zzui/new_algorithm_developed_to_improve_the_longterm/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/173zzui/new_algorithm_developed_to_improve_the_longterm/">[comments]</a></span>
