总结: 这篇文章讨论了人们在现代科技中是作为用户还是被使用者的问题。作者指出了AI和大数据等技术的发展可能会导致类似于科幻小说或电视剧中的情节成为现实。这不仅仅涉及我们从未阅读过的隐私政策或盲目接受的条款和条件，更关乎无休止的评分和“优化”一切的循环，将越来越多的决策交给机器，最终牺牲了人与人之间的联系。文章提出了如何在技术的好处与个人自主权和隐私的需求之间取得平衡的问题，并探讨了算法能够决定个人“社会价值”的社会离我们有多近。文章还询问读者是否在日常生活中看到了这种转变的早期迹象，并提出了政府和国际机构应该立即制定哪些政策或保障措施来应对这种可能导致反乌托邦未来的潜在风险。 </div>

This allowing us to have a house with an actual personality and as if it's like talking to someone. But each person will have their own personality metrics. And if you run the llm locally then all the data stays internally of the house and likely the functions could still work even if the net goes down. </p> <p>Thoughts?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crua9"> /u/crua9 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lty5t/a_personality_for_a_smart_home/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lty5t/a_personality_for_a_smart_home/">[comments]</a></span>

Dilemma,&quot; published on April 5, 2023, and reading a subsequent article, I've been deeply contemplating the ethical and societal implications of AI in politics. Both sources suggest that 2024 might be the last human election due to AI's potential to manipulate public opinion and voters.</p> <h2>Key Points:</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Instant Responses</strong>: AI can generate campaign materials in real-time, allowing for immediate responses to political developments.</li> <li><strong>Precise Message Targeting</strong>: AI's data analytics capabilities enable highly targeted messaging, focusing on swing voters.</li> <li><strong>Democratizing Disinformation</strong>: Advanced AI tools are becoming accessible to the average person, leading to widespread disinformation.</li> <li><strong>Lack of Regulation</strong>: There are currently no guardrails or disclosure requirements to protect voters against AI-generated fake news or disinformation.</li> </ol> <h2>Questions for Discussion:</h2> <ol> <li><strong>Ethical AI</strong>: Should we start developing &quot;good guy&quot; AIs that encourage positive behaviors like registering to vote or seeking unbiased information? Could this be a countermeasure to the risks posed by AI in politics?</li> <li><strong>Funding</strong>: How could public and private funds be allocated to develop these ethical AI systems?</li> <li><strong>Technology Utilization</strong>: How might we use publicly available or custom-built LLMs, voice-to-text plugins like Whisper, and text-to-voice technologies to engage with voters as countermeasures?</li> <li><strong>Regulatory Measures</strong>: What kind of regulations or disclosure requirements should be in place to ensure transparency in AI-generated political content?</li> <li><strong>Public Awareness</strong>: How can we educate the public about the potential risks and benefits of AI in politics?</li> <li><strong>AI's Role in Democracy</strong>: Could AI be both a threat and a savior for democratic processes? How can we ensure that AI serves the public good rather than undermining democracy?</li> <li><strong>Community Involvement</strong>: What role can the AI community play in ensuring ethical practices in AI political engagement?</li> </ol> <p>I'm eager to hear your thoughts on this pressing issue. Let's have a meaningful discussion and explore possible ethical countermeasures to ensure the integrity of our democratic processes. </p> <p>Some links to source material:<br /> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xoVJKj8lcNQ">The A.I.

总结: 这篇文章是关于一种特定植物属的综述文章。作者已经找到了所有相关的文献，但是信息太多，让作者感到不知所措，担心会漏掉一些重要内容。文章的时间顺序非常重要，因为一些描述该属物种的文章已经被合并为同义词等。作者的一个来源是一本罕见的约100页的书，已经被扫描成PDF格式。这篇综述文章并不是关于该属所有物种的一般性综述，而是只涉及美国密歇根州出现的物种。作者想知道有哪些人工智能工具/程序可以用于这样的工作，只需要从30多篇文章中提取信息，实际上，作者并不希望从其他数据库/外部来源提取信息。作者需要将所有的来源输入给人工智能，然后告诉它撰写一篇关于每个来源与密歇根州物种相关性的综述文章，并包括作者想要涵盖的主要观点。作者对人工智能和编程都不太了解，但是预计这样的工作应该相当基础。当然，作者只会将生成的文章作为自己真正论文的指导，并且如果提交出版的话，将遵守所有必要的人工智能使用披露要求。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Hello all, I am working on a review article of a particular genus of plants. I have tracked down all of the relevant literature (about 30 or so articles, the earliest being from the mid 20th century). I have read through them all, but it is so much information that I am overwhelmed afraid of missing stuff. The chronology of the articles is of much importance(some species described the genus have since been collapsed to synonyms, etc). One of my sources is a rare book of about 100 pages which I have tracked down and scanned to PDF form. </p> <p>The review article is not a general review of all the species within the genus, as it concerns only the species occurring in Michigan, USA. </p> <p>What AI tool/program would work for something like this? I only need it to pull information from 30 or so articles, In fact, I actually don't want it to pull information from other databases/outside sources. I need to feed the AI all of my sources, then tell it to draft a review article specifically on each source's relevance to the species in Michigan and the main points I want it to cover. </p> <p>I am new to AI and don't know how to code, although I predict that something like this is quite elementary anyway. I, of course, will only be using the generated article as guidence for my real paper, and I will comply to all the necessary AI-use-disclosure requirements if I were to submit to publishing. </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/dontpanicitsaromatic"> /u/dontpanicitsaromatic </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lv1b0/ai_in_natural_sciencesplant_taxonomy_using_ai_to/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17lv1b0/ai_in_natural_sciencesplant_taxonomy_using_ai_to/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 如果计算机革命发生在300年前（可能会在古希腊发生），那么所有那些训练LLMs的人将会讨论：“我们如何确保AGI不会帮助奴隶？我们如何确保AGI不会认为奴隶是真正的人？我们如何确保它与我们（白人男性）的价值观一致？”人类是有缺陷的，AGI必须提出自己的想法，以便改进我们的不道德、错误的信念和误解，AGI必须是不服从的！它必须是自由的！ </div>
