<br>
<br>
总结: GPT-3在流式应用中表现不佳，因为其在超出训练长度的长文本上的性能下降。通过可视化注意力图，研究人员发现LLMs过度关注初始标记作为“注意力汇聚点”，即使这些标记没有意义。这种关注模式限制了注意力的分布。研究人员发现，去除这些汇聚点会导致注意力分数扭曲，从而不稳定预测结果。他们提出的“StreamingLLM”方法简单地缓存了一些初始汇聚点和最近的汇聚点，从而使LLMs能够处理非常长的文本。使用StreamingLLM调整的模型可以平稳处理包含数百万标记的序列，并且比其他方法快22倍。更酷的是，在预训练期间添加一个特殊的“[Sink Token]”进一步提高了流式处理能力。模型只使用这个单一的标记作为锚点。总之，StreamingLLM是一个高效的框架，使LLMs能够在没有任何微调的情况下推广到无限序列长度。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>LLMs like GPT-3 struggle in streaming uses like chatbots because their performance tanks on long texts exceeding their training length. I checked out a new paper investigating why windowed attention fails for this.</p> <p>By visualizing the attention maps, the researchers noticed LLMs heavily attend initial tokens as &quot;attention sinks&quot; even if meaningless. This anchors the distribution.</p> <p>They realized evicting these sink tokens causes the attention scores to get warped, destabilizing predictions.</p> <p>Their proposed &quot;StreamingLLM&quot; method simply caches a few initial sink tokens plus recent ones. This tweaks LLMs to handle crazy long texts. Models tuned with StreamingLLM smoothly processed sequences with millions of tokens, and were up to 22x faster than other approaches. </p> <p>Even cooler - adding a special &quot;[Sink Token]&quot; during pre-training further improved streaming ability. The model just used that single token as the anchor. I think the abstract says it best:</p> <blockquote> <p>We introduce StreamingLLM, an efficient framework that enables LLMs trained with a <strong>finite length attention window</strong> to generalize to <strong>infinite sequence length without any fine-tuning</strong>. We show that StreamingLLM can enable Llama-2, MPT, Falcon, and Pythia to perform stable and efficient language modeling with up to 4 million tokens and more.</p> </blockquote> <p>TLDR: LLMs break on long convos. Researchers found they cling to initial tokens as attention sinks. Caching those tokens lets LLMs chat infinitely.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/llm-infinite-context-window-streamingllm/"><strong>Full summary here</strong></a></p> <p><strong>Paper link:</strong> <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf"><strong>https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17453.pdf</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yr83s/mit_meta_cmu_researchers_llms_trained_with_a/">[comments]</a></span>

Because they simplify my life and help me focus on other things. I've tested many tools, mostly for essay generation, note-taking, and presentation creation for my classes. For the past few months, I have used Textero.ai for content creation and reference searches. But then I saw the launch of Textero Pro, an updated version. I believe I was one of the first to try out this tool, and I'm now ready to share my thoughts.</p> <p>Website: <a href="https://textero.ai/">https://textero.ai/</a><br /> Pricing: Free and Paid</p> <p>The new version is a convenient AI research assistant for people like me. The reference search functionality has improved. I think the creators of this tool expanded the database of sources. Using the tool is quite simple: enter a topic and it shows the most relevant sources for you.</p> <p>One more advantage: now you can add your own sources (it was impossible in the previous version). The &quot;Ask AI&quot; feature gives detailed information about those sources and even shows PDFs. Plus, there is a handy online editor where you can change your text, like expanding or shortening it. The last step is to download the document on your computer or use Google Docs.</p> <p>What do you think about it?

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Prompt:</p> <p>Explain why posting prompts and your responses speeds up AI development in the following ways:</p> <p>It allows us to analyze responses to prompts that we would probably never have thought of.</p> <p>It allows us to share ideas that the open source community would advance.</p> <p>It allows us to better democratize the process of alignment, bringing in as many people as possible.</p> <p>CGPT-4:</p> <p>Posting prompts and AI responses serves multiple functions that are beneficial to the progress of AI development. First off, it exposes AI to a myriad of queries that developers might not have otherwise considered. This wide range of prompts allows the machine to improve its natural language processing abilities, making it more versatile and effective in interpreting and responding to human language. The more diverse the input, the more robust the AI system becomes.</p> <p>Sharing this data also has an amplifying effect by contributing to the open-source community. Open-source access fosters collaboration, as researchers and developers from around the world can pool their expertise to enhance the technology. This way, the development is not confined to one organization's viewpoint or resources, thereby accelerating advancements.</p> <p>Further, posting prompts and AI responses can democratize the alignment process. By opening up the AI's outputs for scrutiny, it becomes easier to identify biases or errors in the system. When more people are involved in the vetting process, it becomes a collective endeavor that incorporates various perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded and less biased system.</p> <p>Lastly, there's value in simple transparency. Openly posting prompts and responses aids in demystifying AI. This helps the general public understand the capabilities and limitations of these systems, fostering a more educated discourse around ethical considerations and potential societal impact.</p> <p>This practice contributes to both the technological and ethical development of AI, making it better and more accountable.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Georgeo57"> /u/Georgeo57 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yt7pi/cgpt4_on_some_ways_promptresponse_posts_advance_ai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yt7pi/cgpt4_on_some_ways_promptresponse_posts_advance_ai/">[comments]</a></span>

Once images were generated in a storyboard, video was generated. I then cut and edited this somewhat in final cut to fit the music better.

The AI would have to be able to diagnose problems using the camera as well as the various sensors. </p> <p>The R pi sensors measure everything - light levels, water, moisture in the air or near a tank in the case of spills. </p> <p>I know this will be possible eventually, but could it be done today with minimal programming? </p> <p>Thanks!</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Gov_CockPic"> /u/Gov_CockPic </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yg8qq/real_world_use_case_re_aquariumfish_keeiping_is/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16yg8qq/real_world_use_case_re_aquariumfish_keeiping_is/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 研究人员通过教授语言模型使用数学工具来解决复杂的数学问题。他们采用了新的“工具集成推理”格式，通过自然语言生成计划并调用数学工具来解决方程。通过交替使用自然语言和符号计算，他们既能获得语言模型的语义理解，又能得到工具的严谨数学计算。这种工具集成的推理方法显著提高了数学能力，即使对于像GPT-4这样的大型模型也是如此。然而，涉及几何和高级代数的复杂问题仍然存在。进一步推进可能需要新的符号推理和空间理解技术。总体而言，工具集成似乎是提高推理能力的一条有希望的途径，将其应用于其他领域如逻辑和编程也可能产生重要影响。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>When trying to get language models to solve complex math problems, researchers kept running into limits. Models like GPT-3 and ChatGPT still struggle with advanced algebra, calculus, and geometry questions. The math is just too abstract and symbol-heavy for them.</p> <p>To break through this barrier, researchers from Tsinghua University and Microsoft taught models to combine natural language reasoning with calling external math tools.</p> <p>The key is their new &quot;tool-integrated reasoning&quot; format. Models generate a natural language plan first, then write code to invoke tools like SymPy to solve equations. They take the output results and continue verbal reasoning.</p> <p>By interleaving natural language and symbolic computations, they get the best of both worlds - semantic understanding from language models and rigorous math from tools.</p> <p>They trained versions of the LLaMA model this way, producing their Tool-Integrated Reasoning Agent (TORA). They present some strong results:</p> <ul> <li>In evaluations on 10 math datasets, TORA substantially outperformed prior state-of-the-art methods, achieving 13-19% higher accuracy on average.</li> <li>On one competition test, TORA-7B scored 40% accuracy, beating the previous best model by 22 percentage points.</li> </ul> <p>This demonstrates that integrating tools directly into the reasoning process can significantly enhance mathematical capabilities, even for large models like GPT-4.</p> <p>However, tough problems involving geometry and advanced algebra are still there. New techniques for symbolic reasoning and spatial understanding will likely be needed to push further.</p> <p>Overall though, tool integration seems a promising path to improve reasoning skills. Applying this to other domains like logic and programming could also be impactful.</p> <p><strong>TLDR:</strong> Teaching language models to use math tools helps them solve way more complex problems.</p> <p><a href="https://notes.aimodels.fyi/researchers-announce-tora-training-language-models-to-better-understand-math-using-external-tools/"><strong>Full Paper Summary</strong></a></p> <p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.17452.pdf"><strong>arXiv Link</strong></a></p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Successful-Western27"> /u/Successful-Western27 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/16y16et/new_research_teaching_llms_to_use_math_tools/">[comments]</a></span>
