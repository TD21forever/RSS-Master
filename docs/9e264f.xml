Qualcomm claims it is faster than Apple's M2 Max chip at some tasks and more energy efficient than both Apple and Intel PC chips.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft is outdoing its biggest rival, Google, in the AI game</strong><br /> - From the two tech giants’ September-quarter results, growth at Microsoft’s Azure cloud unit (and the company generally) accelerated in the quarter due to higher-than-expected consumption of AI-related services. In the same quarter, Google Cloud earnings slowed by nearly 6 percentage points.</li> <li><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy S24 is your upcoming pocket AI machine</strong><br /> - Going all in with AI on its next flagship, Samsung wants to make the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 Ultra the smartest AI phones ever. The series will have features lifted straight from ChatGPT and Google Bard, and Samsung has designed on its own. Many of them will be available online and offline, and some Samsung features will be improved.</li> <li><strong>Google Photos will soon give you more say in its AI-created video highlights</strong><br /> - With the latest Google Photos update, you can prompt AI-generated videos by searching for specific tags like places, people, or activities. Once generated, you can trim clips, rearrange them, or swap out music for something better.</li> <li><strong>Lenovo and NVIDIA announce hybrid AI solutions to help enterprises quickly adopt GenAI</strong><br /> - The new end-to-end solutions include accelerated systems, AI software, and expert services to build and deploy domain-specific AI models with ease.</li> <li><strong>Amazon's AI-powered van inspections give it a powerful new data feed</strong><br /> - Amazon delivery drivers at sites around the world will be asked to drive through camera-studded archways at the end of shifts. The data gathered will be used by algorithms to identify whether the vehicle is damaged or needs maintenance, picking up every scratch, dent, nail in a tire, or crack in the windshield.</li> <li><strong>IBM acquires Manta Software Inc. to complement data and AI governance capabilities</strong><br /> - Manta’s data lineage capabilities help increase transparency within watsonx so businesses can determine whether the right data was used for their AI models and systems, where it originated, how it has evolved and any discrepancies in data flows.</li> <li><strong>This new data poisoning tool lets artists fight back against GenAI</strong><br /> - The tool, called Nightshade, lets artists add invisible changes to the pixels in their art before they upload it online so that if it’s scraped into an AI training set, it can cause the resulting model to break in chaotic and unpredictable ways. This “poisoning” of training data could damage future iterations of image-generating AI models, such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.<br /></li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/qualcomms-new-ai-chip-to-rival-apple-and-intel">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g9nyu/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10252023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g9nyu/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10252023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: LAION推出Open Empathic项目，旨在为开源AI系统赋予共情和情感智能。希望通过该项目的框架和研究人员、技术爱好者的社区，彻底改变AI与人类在各个领域的互动和支持方式。随着AI在我们生活中的影响越来越大，AI系统具备情感智能以理解和回应人类情感变得至关重要。情感智能的AI带来的一些好处包括：赋予学生和学习者更多权力、推动心理研究的进展、改善心理健康支持、道德决策的提升、革新娱乐产业。LAION计划创建一个包含有关情感内容的音频数据集，类似于他们在年初进行的RLHF。您对音频数据的注释将在训练AI模型方面起到关键作用，这些模型不仅能理解情感，还能以共情的方式回应。重点不是让AI拥有情感，而是赋予它们情感智能。 </div>

The hope is that the framework of this project, together with a community of researchers and technology enthusiasts, will revolutionize the way AI interacts with and supports humans in various domains.</p> <p>It is important that AI systems possess emotional intelligence to understand and respond to human emotions as AI becomes more impactful in our lives, it becomes vital to prioritize the well-being and emotional intelligence of AI-human interactions.</p> <p>Few of the benefits of an emotionally intelligent AI are:</p> <ol> <li>Empowering Students and Learners</li> <li>Advancing Psychological Research</li> <li>Improved Mental Health Support</li> <li>Ethical Decision-Making</li> <li>Revolutionizing the Entertainment Industry</li> </ol> <p>LAION plans to create a dataset of audio that contains information about the emotional content in a similar way to the RLHF they did in the beginning of the year.</p> <p>Your annotations of audio data will play a pivotal role in training AI models that not only comprehend emotions but also respond empathetically. The point is not to give AI emotions but to give them emotional intelligence,</p> <p>There's a link on the top of this post leading to the site, on that link there's also a tutorial on how to contribute to the dataset.

总结: 通过AI、物联网、区块链技术和加密货币等一系列创新发明，我们的世界正处于一场技术革命的浪潮之中。我坚信，区块链和人工智能的结合将通过一系列人工智能加密货币项目，彻底改变去中心化金融市场。通过引入新功能，加密货币项目将人工智能的力量与其当前的倡议相结合。例如，Etherscan引入了用于智能合约审查的代码阅读器人工智能。NeuroChain专注于人工智能和智能学习。Clarins使用NeuroChain的区块链技术来确认成分的供应链，而Render是一个旨在构建提供渲染工作负载高性能计算服务的去中心化计算机网络的人工智能加密货币项目。SingularityNET是一个基于区块链的平台，使任何人都能够开发、分发和收费人工智能服务。有几个类似的倡议，但你会选择突出哪一个，为什么？ </div>

Etherscan, for instance, introduced code reader AI for the examination of smart contracts.<br /> NeuroChain is all about artificial intelligence and smart learning. Clarins uses Neurochain's blockchain technology to confirm the components' supply chain, and Render is an AI cryptocurrency project that seeks to build a decentralized computer network that provides high-performance computing services for rendering workloads.<br /> SingularityNET is a blockchain-based platform that makes it simple for anybody to develop, distribute, and charge for AI services.<br /> There are several initiatives that are comparable, but which one would you highlight and why?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Junpw"> /u/Junpw </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g6vo4/which_project_would_you_highlight_and_why/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g6vo4/which_project_would_you_highlight_and_why/">[comments]</a></span>
