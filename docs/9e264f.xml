总结: Nightshade是一种创新工具，可以帮助艺术家对抗人工智能的滥用。通过对作品进行微妙的、难以察觉的改变，Nightshade可以在经过人工智能算法处理后产生不可预测和破坏性的结果。Nightshade主要针对那些利用艺术家作品来训练模型的人工智能公司，有效地“污染”了数据。 </div>

This innovative tool empowers artists to introduce subtle imperceptible changes to their creations. When subjected to AI algorithms, these alterations result in unpredictable and disruptive outcomes.

Qualcomm claims it is faster than Apple's M2 Max chip at some tasks and more energy efficient than both Apple and Intel PC chips.</li> <li><strong>Microsoft is outdoing its biggest rival, Google, in the AI game</strong><br /> - From the two tech giants’ September-quarter results, growth at Microsoft’s Azure cloud unit (and the company generally) accelerated in the quarter due to higher-than-expected consumption of AI-related services. In the same quarter, Google Cloud earnings slowed by nearly 6 percentage points.</li> <li><strong>Samsung’s Galaxy S24 is your upcoming pocket AI machine</strong><br /> - Going all in with AI on its next flagship, Samsung wants to make the Galaxy S24, Galaxy S24+, and Galaxy S24 Ultra the smartest AI phones ever. The series will have features lifted straight from ChatGPT and Google Bard, and Samsung has designed on its own. Many of them will be available online and offline, and some Samsung features will be improved.</li> <li><strong>Google Photos will soon give you more say in its AI-created video highlights</strong><br /> - With the latest Google Photos update, you can prompt AI-generated videos by searching for specific tags like places, people, or activities. Once generated, you can trim clips, rearrange them, or swap out music for something better.</li> <li><strong>Lenovo and NVIDIA announce hybrid AI solutions to help enterprises quickly adopt GenAI</strong><br /> - The new end-to-end solutions include accelerated systems, AI software, and expert services to build and deploy domain-specific AI models with ease.</li> <li><strong>Amazon's AI-powered van inspections give it a powerful new data feed</strong><br /> - Amazon delivery drivers at sites around the world will be asked to drive through camera-studded archways at the end of shifts. The data gathered will be used by algorithms to identify whether the vehicle is damaged or needs maintenance, picking up every scratch, dent, nail in a tire, or crack in the windshield.</li> <li><strong>IBM acquires Manta Software Inc. to complement data and AI governance capabilities</strong><br /> - Manta’s data lineage capabilities help increase transparency within watsonx so businesses can determine whether the right data was used for their AI models and systems, where it originated, how it has evolved and any discrepancies in data flows.</li> <li><strong>This new data poisoning tool lets artists fight back against GenAI</strong><br /> - The tool, called Nightshade, lets artists add invisible changes to the pixels in their art before they upload it online so that if it’s scraped into an AI training set, it can cause the resulting model to break in chaotic and unpredictable ways. This “poisoning” of training data could damage future iterations of image-generating AI models, such as DALL-E, Midjourney, and Stable Diffusion.<br /></li> </ul> <p>More detailed breakdown of these news and innovations in the <a href="https://theaiedge.substack.com/p/qualcomms-new-ai-chip-to-rival-apple-and-intel">daily newsletter</a>.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/RohitAkki"> /u/RohitAkki </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g9nyu/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10252023_news_from/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17g9nyu/twominute_daily_ai_update_date_10252023_news_from/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讲述了一个非营利科技公司与政府合作，致力于推动印度农村和低收入地区的幼儿教育（6岁及以下）。文章提到他们已经有一个产品，并且通常由内部团队负责内容创作。目前，作者正在为不同年龄段的新垂直领域进行设置，并需要对内容进行原型设计，特别是包含配音的各种视频。作者尝试使用veed.io进行实验，并认为如果能够使用人工智能生成音频，工作速度将提高10倍。作者还提到希望能够找到最适合创建印地语人工智能配音的软件（最好是免费的，因为预算有限）。 </div>

总结: AI中没有防御模式，AI无法理解防御。如果将其武器化，那只会走向一种结果，即升级理论。如果你决定毒害一个AI模型，对此的自然对策就是毒害你的AI模型。Nightshade是一个GAN，它被设计为GAN中的生成器。我能想到的最简单的对抗方法就是直接毒害你的GAN，释放一个毒害Nightshade的模型。这将是最自然的对抗方式。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>There is no Defensive Mode in AI. Defense is a feature that AI does not understand. If you weaponize it, then that only goes one way. Escalation theory. If you decide to poison an AI model, the natural counter to that is to poison your AI model back. Nightshade is a GAN. It is designed to be the Generator within the GAN. The easiest method I could possibly come up with to counter this method would be to flat out poison your GAN. To release a model that poisons Nightshade. That would be the most natural counter to it.</p> <p>The reason why this code is so long, and complex, is because I very actively chose to avoid that method. All this code does is detect the adversary. It is a defensive tool as written, rather than an offensive one. It would have been 10x easier to create code that poisons any model that tries to poison another model. Where would that get AI in the end? An eye for an eye is a crappy methodology for humans to follow, why are we so quick to introduce it to AI models? </p> <p>Do I endorse AI companies scraping web data for profit? No. The opposite. Sue the pants off of any company who has engaged in such practices, that is my stance on that. I hope they lose the court battles. Don't introduce poison to the AI models though because the companies that created them scraped data. That is counter intuitive on too many levels for me to support. That is why Nightshade Antidote exists. That is why an antidote will be quickly invented and released for anyone else who tries similar tactics.</p> <p><a href="https://turingssolutions.com/f/nightshade-antidote---detect-poison-in-your-ai-model">https://turingssolutions.com/f/nightshade-antidote---detect-poison-in-your-ai-model</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Fantastic-Ninja3839"> /u/Fantastic-Ninja3839 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17folbw/nightshade_antidote_detect_poison_in_your_ai_model/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17folbw/nightshade_antidote_detect_poison_in_your_ai_model/">[comments]</a></span>
