总结: 最近我向人工智能提出了一个逻辑问题，它使用了类似于“猜大猜小”的迭代过程来解决问题，这种方法需要大量的处理能力和内存，不断添加下一个迭代直到达到目标。然而，正确的解决方案是使用一个公式，只需要一个过程就能完成任务。现在，考虑一下。神经网络使用了一种类似于“猜大猜小”的反向传播系统，它通过增加权重来最终获得所需的结果。这需要大量的处理能力。那么现在想一想，逻辑问题的正确解决方案是直接使用一个公式而不是迭代过程。是否可能存在一种神经网络可以使用的公式，而不需要使用如此巨大的处理能力和内存呢？（这是尚未发现的东西？）SQL数据库使用索引系统来加速数据搜索。还有一种与数组一起使用的二分搜索可以减少处理时间。这是一个值得思考的问题。 </div>

总结: 过去的社交媒体主要是朋友们分享日常生活，但在2010年左右，越来越多的朋友开始分享新闻文章。与此同时，我们的动态中也开始出现越来越多的广告。在过去的十年里，社交媒体让我感觉我几乎不再了解这些人，而不是让我感觉更亲近。最近，我看到Facebook正在引入AI机器人，这些机器人具有名人的个性。其他社交媒体平台会不会也效仿？目标是让人们与名人的AI复制品互动比与自己的朋友更多吗？再加上我在每个“朋友”的帖子之间看到3-4个广告，我对人与人之间互动的未来并不抱有太多希望。你认为在未来几年里，AI会如何改变我们与社交媒体的互动方式？AI是否有办法让我们与其他人感觉更加连接？ </div>

But for the past decade or so, it has made me feel, for the most part, like I don't even know these people anymore. </p> <p>I saw recently that Facebook is introducing AI bots that take on the personalities of celebrities. Will other social media platforms do the same? Is the goal to have humans interacting more with AI replicas of famous people than their own friends? Combine this with the fact that I see 3-4 ads between every single post from a &quot;friend&quot; and I don't exactly feel hopeful for the future of human-human interaction.</p> <p>How do you think AI will change how we engage with social media over the next few years?

Luckily we live in an era where through audio messages and social media presence, many memories will remain.</p> <p>The case that I have in mind, is feeding some AI platform with his voice recordings over time, to create a synthetic voice that can read any text. This would help the mother have a &quot;conversation&quot; with him. Their native language is spanish, but I still believe any english &quot;speaking &quot;tool would do the trick.</p> <p>A more advanced scenario would be uploading images or videos of him, to create some avatar that could interact with, at least reading from a manually input text or ideally from a chatbot AI.</p> <p>Do you know any platform that could help me achieve this goal?

总结: 该文讨论了作者对于开发一个定制化的大型语言模型（LLM）的渴望，该模型能够模仿ChatGPT，并根据作者提供的数据在回答问题方面表现出色。作者提到了一些现有的模型，如Private-GPT和Gpt4all，但他的最终目标是要么从头开始创建一个定制的LLM，要么对现有的模型（如BERT或GPT-7B）进行微调以满足他的独特需求。作者还提到了他正在关注Andrej Karpathy关于构建类似GPT的模型的讲座，但他注意到该模型只能生成类似莎士比亚散文的连续循环文本，而不能回答问题。因此，作者追求的核心目标包括：1. 为回答问题的任务进行有效的数据准备；2. 策略性地选择预训练模型，如BERT或GPT-7B；3. 进行严格的性能评估，采用相关的指标；4. 创建一个高效的推理系统，方便问题输入和回答生成。 </div>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了Reddit上出现的一些帖子，这些帖子都是由自动生成的账号发布的，这些账号的命名方式都是形容词+名词的模式，并且帖子内容听起来非常像人类写的。作者怀疑这些账号是由机器人自动生成的，对于这种机器人账号的存在感到印象深刻和害怕。 </div>
