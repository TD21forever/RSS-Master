总结: Embark Studios的游戏《The Finals》因使用AI播音员而引发争议。声优Gianni Matragrano认为AI无法达到专业质量，引发了对声优就业岗位的担忧。一些玩家赞赏动态的AI播音员，而其他人则认为这是一种削减成本的措施。尽管受到批评，Embark Studios仍然坚持使用AI。AI生成的声音对游戏体验产生了负面影响，声优们也在反击。有希望玩家的反馈可能会影响游戏回归人类声优。这一争议凸显了游戏行业对AI和声优未来的持续辩论。 </div>

Voice actor Gianni Matragrano argues that AI can't match professional quality, sparking concerns about job loss for voice actors. Some players appreciate the dynamic AI announcers, while others see it as a cost-cutting measure. Embark Studios defends its use of AI, despite criticism. The AI-generated voices have impacted gameplay negatively, and voice actors are pushing back. There's hope that player feedback may influence a return to human voice actors in the game. The controversy highlights the gaming industry's ongoing debate about AI and the future of voice acting.</p> <p>Check here for more coverage <a href="https://www.brief.news/stories/83586921-5266-44fb-915a-9b72f5459f1b">daily briefs</a> </p> <p>More detailed breakdown of this news find it from this <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2023/10/29/the-finals-is-using-ai-voicework-and-it-is-bad/">source</a> </p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/High_Sleep3694"> /u/High_Sleep3694 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17l44py/ai_announcers_in_embark_studios_the_finals_spark/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>This summary was written by Bing Chat, please do not beat the AI models with the nerf bat due to this, our benevolent corporate overlords. </p> <p>The article that is available on Arxiv is titled, ‘Analyzing the Impact of Companies on AI Research Based on Publications’. It was published in the journal Scientometrics in October 2023 by Michael Färber and Lazaros Tampakis1. It is an interesting and insightful paper that examines how companies influence AI research based on their publishing activities.</p> <p>The paper compares academic- and company-authored AI publications published in the last decade and uses scientometric data from multiple scholarly databases to look for differences across these groups and to disclose the top contributing organizations. The paper finds that while the majority of publications is still produced by academia, publications with company participation receive significantly more citations and online attention. The paper also provides recommendations to safeguard a harmonious balance between academia and industry in the realm of AI research.</p> <p>The paper cites some negative implications for corporate research vs purely academic research when it comes to AI, such as:</p> <p>- The risk of losing academic freedom and integrity, as companies may have vested interests or agendas that influence the direction and outcome of AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of creating a knowledge gap and a power imbalance, as companies may have more resources and access to data than academia, giving them an unfair advantage in AI research.</p> <p>- The risk of neglecting ethical and social issues, as companies may prioritize profit and innovation over the welfare and rights of humans and other stakeholders affected by AI.</p> <p>To address these issues, the paper suggests several strategies, such as:</p> <p>- Promoting fair access and collaboration, by creating platforms and incentives that facilitate data sharing, joint projects, and peer review between academia and industry.</p> <p>- Maintaining academic freedom and integrity, by establishing clear guidelines and policies that regulate the involvement and influence of companies in AI research.</p> <p>- Addressing ethical and social issues, by involving diverse perspectives and stakeholders in the design, development, and evaluation of AI systems.</p> <p>I hope this summary gives you an overview of the article.

总结: 这篇文章讨论了像ChatGPT这样的机器人是如何工作的。作者提出了一个问题，即如何使AI能够同时与大约100万人进行对话，并具有相同的智能。当AI在一般任务上变得和普通人一样出色时，就会有100万个数字工作者，他们可以同时处理任意数量的不同事物，只要这些工作可以通过计算机完成。这些工作者可以全天候工作，并且如果需要让他们同时在一个项目上工作，可以设置一个“虚假”的企业结构，其中包含所有的工作，从而像从无到有地创建创业公司，直到项目完成。这只是一个16岁瑞典人的随机思考。 </div>

And a thing i want to bring up is how the ai can be instanced so that Around 1 million people can talk to an AI of the same intelligence simultaneously. Ith many different topics and questions. Now imagine when that ai becomes as good as the average person for general tasks. Then you have 1000000 digital workers which can work on any amount of different things simultaneously just as good as the average human if the work can be done form a computer. That can work 24/7. An dif you want may of them to work on a single project at once you set up a ''fake'' Corporate structure with all the jobs therein basically making start ups form thin air untilt he pprject is completed.

总结: 这篇文章介绍了使用LM Studio和memgpt来运行自定义的LLM，并且可以通过autogen来配置任务和功能。作者还提到了可以通过训练自己的LLM来进一步提升性能。虽然这不是一个完美的解决方案，但作者认为这是目前最好的选择。此外，作者还提出了一个理论，即通过memgpt可以实现一个与个人成长相适应的AI，随着技术的进步，它可以成为完美的个性化AI。 </div>

More than less this is using LM Studio to let you run whatever LLM you want. You can run autogen to give it the task and abilities you want. Plus if you want to use multiple bots you can. And then you're using memgpt for long term memory. This letting it remember things and recall as needed instead of you having to constantly remind it.</p> <p>You can step this up by training your own LLM. The video doesn't get into this.</p> <p>This isn't a perfect solution, but I think it's the best we got at this point. </p> <p>&#x200b;</p> <p>I have a theory that it might be possible with memgpt basically you can have a AI that grows with you. Like you can switch out and update the LLM over time, and have it refer to memgpt to get all its former memories. And as the tech gets better it can in theory become your perfect personalized AI.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/crua9"> /u/crua9 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17ko74v/howto_run_your_own_ai_llm_for_free_locally/">[comments]</a></span>

总结: 这篇文章讨论了一个关于应用程序中使用AI比较用户提供的描述与预设参数的问题。作者希望能够在没有互联网连接的情况下，在应用程序中使用一个可以与游戏一起运行并通过本地网络IP使用API进行通信的工具。作者尝试了chat gpt 3.5，但由于其运行在OpenAI服务器上，所以不符合要求。 </div>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Good day, everyone. I have the following problem.</p> <p>I have an application (A mental development game) that has several arrays containing various properties for an object, such as:</p> <p>color [red, green, blue, yellow]</p> <p>shape [square, triangle, circle],</p> <p>outline color [red outline, blue outline]</p> <p>outline shape [dotted, solid, dashed]</p> <p>size [small, marge, medium]</p> <p>and many more...</p> <p>It loops through all the arrays and randomly picks out properties, then presents a shape to a user. The user then needs to type in the description of the object.</p> <p>What I'd like to do is have the AI compare if the user-provided description contains all parameters or if something is missing. Maybe output a 80% specifying how accurate the description was, based on how many correct parameters were included. The application knows wat parameters were used. Can even store all the parameters as a single string.</p> <p>What can I use to achieve this? Is it possible to make something that can run on the users computer without requiring internet connection and can be included with the game (Made using Godot Engine) perhaps something that launches alongside the game and communicated with each other using an api via local network ip?</p> <p>I experimented with chat gpt 3.5 and it gave flawless answers but... that's chat gpt for ya. Running on OpenAI servers.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/TheConceptBoy"> /u/TheConceptBoy </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17kmcyi/id_like_to_have_ai_check_user_text_for_number_of/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArtificialInteligence/comments/17kmcyi/id_like_to_have_ai_check_user_text_for_number_of/">[comments]</a></span>
