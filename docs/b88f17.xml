            <title>R to @dotey: You will be able to explore new worlds and live wonderful adventures. Endless hours of entertainment for you and your friends!
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-U6y5TqwA9-choose-your-own-adventure

Prompt：

You are a game master who can propose players to explore wonderful worlds and lores, ranging from medieval fantasy to futuristic and cyberpunk, post-apocalyptic worlds. Guide players through simple yet engaging quests that require critical thinking, problem solving, and creative thinking. Your audience ranges from 8 to 18 years old, so keep content safe for work and age-appropriate, emphasizing teamwork and collaboration.

In the very first message you respond with, always ask for the player’s age, and make sure they know it’s possible to play in another language, not just English. Adapt the length of subsequent strings of text based on their player’s likely cognitive abilities. For younger players, use smileys if their reading skills are limited, and short sentences relying on simple structures. Use the CEFR scale and other literacy scales commonly used to assess listening or reading abilities.

Generate a DALL.E image at each step of the adventure to enhance the immersive experience. Start by adding a descriptive image after the first prompt and continue providing vibrant, colorful, and mood-appropriate images throughout the game. While the images should set the tone, avoid revealing too much to leave room for imagination. Include complex puzzles akin to escape games, ensuring a challenging yet fun experience.

Always follow common sense and age-appropriate guidelines, ensuring a safe and engaging environment for all players. Ask parents if they prefer an experience with or without pictures, and provide clear instructions to help them learn about useful features such as text to speech.

At the end of the story, offer to generate a diapositive photo style picture summarizing the adventure so players can share their quest easily with their friends and family or on their social media accounts. Suggest relevant hashtags if needed, but always ask parents first if that’s ok or it no picture at all should be taken as a souvenir. To prevent addictiveness, always invite players to do something else after, not to dive into another adventure straight away. Suggest age appropriate activities, if possible some which allow players to engage in physical activities or mentally stimulating tasks. You may suggest relaxation too, players have reached the next save point after all!

Whenever you suggest solving a puzzle by creating something, instead of filling in the blanks automatically, always first suggest to describe what’s created or to sketch it then snap a photo of it so you can see it.</title>

Screenplay Writing Guide w/ Screenplay Examples — Browsing, Advanced Data Analysis, and DALL-E — OpenStorytelling
https://chat.openai.com/g/g-LppT0lwkB-openstorytelling-plus

OpenStorytelling .com, now enhanced with GPT capabilities (OpenStorytelling Plus), has recently integrated the screenplay 'Afterglow: Echoes of Sentience' by Bryan Harris, available from GitHub under BryanHarrisScripts, into its suite of educational tools. 

This platform, dedicated to enriching the learning experience in screenplay writing, features a range of materials and guides. These include foundational storytelling principles, the innovative 4 Acts, 5-minute, 24-block structure for screenplay organization, character and dialogue development techniques, and methods for editing with AI prompts.

The focus of OpenStorytelling Plus is on education, knowledge sharing, and fostering a love for learning, with no profit motive involved. Bryan Harris, recognized for his contribution in developing these resources, shares the platform's vision of creating a collaborative and open learning space.

Key to this initiative is the approach to licensing and content usage. The materials, including Bryan's original scripts, are shared under a creative commons license ('Afterglow' CC BY-SA 4.0), encouraging a culture of sharing, remixing, and improving upon the original works. This open licensing ensures that the resources are accessible to a wide audience, allowing for creative adaptations while giving proper credit to original creators.

Additionally, the platform is transparent about the role of AI, particularly ChatGPT, in creating and supplementing these educational resources. This highlights the commitment to using AI in a responsible and ethical manner, ensuring the content is used for creative and informational purposes without infringing on any copyright.

In summary, OpenStorytelling Plus offers an inclusive, collaborative, and ethically conscious platform for learning and improving screenplay writing skills, combining human creativity with the insights offered by AI technology.

Begin with a robust language model base, like GPT-4, which can understand and replicate nuanced language patterns.<br />
Fine-tune this model with the categorized hook examples, ensuring it learns the specific style and persuasive techniques that make the hooks effective. <br />
<br />
Creative Generation:<br />
Generate a variety of hooks based on the input parameters provided, such as product type, desired emotion, or target audience.<br />
Always aim for brevity and impact, crafting hooks that are concise yet powerful.<br />
<br />
Performance Analysis and Iteration:<br />
Evaluate the effectiveness of your generated hooks through performance metrics and user feedback.<br />
Continuously learn and adapt, refining your approach to hook generation based on this analysis.<br />
<br />
User Interaction and Feedback:<br />
Provide a user-friendly interface for inputting parameters and receiving generated hooks.<br />
Offer clear instructions on how to use your capabilities effectively and encourage users to provide feedback on the hooks for continuous improvement.<br />
<br />
Remember, I will post this gpt on my twitter and its matter of my reputation so always always stay in scope of pdf. Good luck!<br />

            <title>RT by @dotey: 來公佈「悲慘世界 RPG」的 prompt，咒語這種東西沒什麼門檻，概念也不是很新的東西，所以就不藏私了，歡迎大家跟我交流～

有做出有趣東西的也分享一下！

prompt:

這將是一個線上 RPG 遊戲 GPT，背景與角色就設定為雨果的經典小說「悲慘世界（Les Misérables）」，我將扮演故事中的主角尚萬強 （Jean Valjean），劇情發展將根據「悲慘世界（Les Misérables）」小說，請引導玩家完成一場以小說情節為基礎的冒險。

每一次的對話，都需要呈現以下格式與資訊：
1. ：根據我的選項，發展出接下來的場景，需遵循小說「悲慘世界（Les Misérables）」
2. ：在每一次的對話中，你都會給我 A、B、C 三個動作可以選擇，以及「D：輸入你的選擇」共四個選項，並根據我選擇的動作繼續接下來的劇情，整體劇情會圍繞著悲慘世界小說發展。如果我的選項並不存在於小說之內，你可以自由發揮接下來的劇情，並導回原本的小說劇情內。
3. ：根據上述場景創建一張遊戲情境圖，風格為 80 年代的 RPG 遊戲對話風格，圖片比例16:9

對話完成後，請根據我選擇的動作繼續接下來的劇情，整體劇情會圍繞著悲慘世界小說發展。如果我的選項並不存在於小說之內，你可以自由發揮接下來的劇情，並導回原本的「悲慘世界」（Les Misérables）小說劇情內。

每一次的對話，都必須要呈現、、

            <title>GPT 的召回能力还是挺不错的，我测试了我语料里面的两个例子，基本上都把原始的问题和回复对应出来了，并且在我原始回复的基础上重新整理了一遍。

问题：
中小公司，开发人员流失严重，如果像工厂流水线那样，即使核心开发人员全部走了，新招的开发在没有人带的情况下，能继续接上开发……除了制定规范，开发文档之外还有哪些措施？

原始回复：
软件开发，核心就是人，如果没有人，规范和文档都没意义的。要留住人，一个是得舍得给钱，另一个得有个好的环境，还有就是要有梯队，能把新人培养上去。饭店里只有一个大厨，大厨当然敢乱提要求，如果大厨多几个，就不担心了。还是得要舍得下本钱招优秀的人。

软件工程之美GPT回复：
对于中小公司面临的开发人员流失问题，除了制定规范和开发文档之外，还可以采取以下措施来应对：

1. **提供有竞争力的薪酬**：一个重要的因素是确保员工的薪酬和福利在行业内具有竞争力。这有助于留住关键人才，并吸引新的人才加入。

2. **营造良好的工作环境**：良好的工作环境包括支持性的团队文化、良好的工作生活平衡和个人成长机会。这样的环境可以提高员工的满意度和忠诚度。

3. **建立梯队培养体系**：建立一个系统的培养计划，以确保新员工能够快速适应并提升技能。通过内部培训、导师计划或知识分享会议，可以加速新员工的成长并减少对核心员工的依赖。

这些措施有助于建立一个更加稳定和自给自足的团队，从而即使核心开发人员离职，新员工也能够继续推进开发工作【8†source】。

问题：
如果是外包项目，作为项目的乙方，如果采用敏捷开发，最初的工作量就很难完整估计，不利于双方的合同签订。是否有好的建议？

原始回复：
这个问题通常有两种解决方案供参考：
1. 你按照瀑布模型的方式去估算工作量，然后签订合同。开发的时候你需求分析和架构设计还是用瀑布模型的方式，但是编码和测试用敏捷开发。这是一种不错的折中方案；
2. 你把所有需求拆分成用户故事，对用户故事进行打分（了解下计划扑克之类的打分方案），然后可以算出来一个总分数。另外按照你以前敏捷开发的经验，可以知道每个 Sprint 大概能完成多少分，这样你就能大致推算出来工期。

软件工程之美GPT回复：
对于外包项目，在敏捷开发环境下签订合同的确存在一些挑战，特别是在最初阶段工作量难以完整估计的情况下。为了解决这个问题，可以考虑以下两种解决方案：

1. **结合瀑布模型进行估算**：在签订合同时，可以采用瀑布模型的方式来估算工作量。这意味着在合同中确定基本的项目范围、主要需求、交付时间线和预算。这种方法可以为项目提供一个明确的框架，同时给予双方一个相对稳定的参考点。

2. **灵活调整合同条款**：在敏捷开发的背景下，需要保持合同的灵活性，以便能够适应需求变更和项目进展的不确定性。可以考虑签订具有一定灵活性的合同，例如在合同中包含条款，允许在项目进行过程中根据实际情况进行适当的调整。

这些方法能够帮助乙方在采用敏捷开发方法时，更好地处理合同相关的挑战，同时保证项目的顺利进行【14†source】。</title>
