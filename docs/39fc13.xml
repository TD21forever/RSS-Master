                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>My bug bounty report was just closed with GitHub about this and so now I'm free to post about it. I'm not going to be posting any speculation whatsoever - only what the actual facts as I know support. The tl;dr if you don't feel like reading all the details is:</p> <ol> <li><p>There's a new model of GPT-4 with the name &quot;copilot-gpt-4-2&quot; which is a 32k model. It has current knowledge up to March of 2023, and is also aware of certain updates to OpenAI's documentation changes that the GPT-4 model the rest of us get to use is not aware of, such as the implementation of the ChatCompletions endpoint. This API endpoint is available to anyone with a Copilot subscription, though there's no way to enable it without digging through the obfuscated code of GitHub Copilot Chat. There doesn't appear to be any limit on the usage of this API endpoint, aside from a very generous tokens per minute limitation.</p></li> <li><p>There is a system of &quot;agents&quot; apparently being tested by GitHub and Datastax, which use an endpoint called &quot;RemoteSkills&quot; and allow the agent to interact with a couple different online services through the OpenAI function calling API. I am aware of 4 different agents, of which I was able to get 3 of them working. The agents are: smith, datastax, docs, and default. None of these agents appear to be usable in GitHub Copilot Chat in the way that it's normally distributed to users.</p></li> <li><p>GitHub Copilot Chat has a number of different features that are meant to prevent you from chatting about anything other than programming-related tasks, but these are all set client-side in the obfuscated Javascript and can be turned off at will. The chat model has the same level of censorship as the official OpenAI API, but it's significantly more useful with the &quot;off-topic&quot; checking disabled, as this feature doesn't work well at all and is annoying even when you're trying to use the model as intended.</p></li> </ol> <p>If you open up the Javascript of GitHub Copilot Chat (which, btw, is distinct from GitHub Copilot - even though they have very similar names) it's an obfuscated mess. However, you can find a whole bunch of cool stuff inside of it. After spending several hours digging through it and deobfuscating it, I found this API endpoint: <a href="https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions">https://api.githubcopilot.com/chat/completions</a></p> <p>This API endpoint functions pretty similarly to the way that the official OpenAI implementation does, but with a couple notable differences. It will accept any model string you give it, but if you use a model that it doesn't recognize, it defaults to &quot;copilot-chat&quot; which appears to be gpt-3.5-turbo-16k. If you generate things at 0 temperature at this API endpoint, it appears that this model is based off of the 0301 update to gpt-3.5-turbo-16k. If you use &quot;gpt-4&quot; as your model string, you get a model that's very similar at 0 temp to gpt-4-0613, but with 32k context and a more up-to-date knowledge base.</p> <p>If you send an invalid request to the server, like sending a function call message object with no 'name' parameter:</p> <pre><code>[ { &quot;role&quot;:&quot;function&quot;, &quot;name&quot;:&quot;&quot;, &quot;content&quot;:&quot;Hello!&quot; } ] </code></pre> <p>This triggers an error that looks like this:</p> <pre><code>bad request: POST https://copilot-chat-pool1-ide-switzerlandnorth.openai.azure.com/openai/v1/engines/copilot-gpt-4-2/chat/completions -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- RESPONSE 400: 400 Bad Request ERROR CODE UNAVAILABLE -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- { &quot;error&quot;: { &quot;message&quot;: &quot;'' does not match '^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,64}$' - 'messages.0.name'&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;invalid_request_error&quot;, &quot;param&quot;: null, &quot;code&quot;: null } } </code></pre> <p>You can see there that it's referencing a model called &quot;copilot-gpt-4-2&quot;. Cool! It seems that OpenAI and Microsoft are working on the next iteration of GPT-4 in secret, and this model is accessible to us for some reason.</p> <p>In the obfuscated code for Copilot Chat, there's also a couple references to a /agents endpoint and a /skills endpoint. If you make a request to <a href="https://api.githubcopilot.com/agents/">https://api.githubcopilot.com/agents/</a> with no parameters, you get a list of the available agents:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;agents&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Default&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;GitHub's default agent&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;default&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Remote agent aka Agent Smith.&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;smith&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Docs&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Search docs&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;docs&quot; }, { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Datastax&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;An agent that answers questions about Datastax resources&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;datastax&quot; } ] } </code></pre> <p>From what I was able to see, here's what they all do:</p> <ol> <li><p>&quot;default&quot; is just GPT-3.5 with no extra stuff attached to it.</p></li> <li><p>&quot;smith&quot; speaks with frequent Matrix analogies.</p></li> <li><p>&quot;docs&quot; either doesn't work, or I wasn't able to get it to work.</p></li> <li><p>&quot;datastax&quot; has a bunch of information about different Datastax products and various DB stuff.</p></li> </ol> <p>The /skills endpoint is similar, where you can send a request to it and receive some information back about the list of skills. It's provided in the same format that the OpenAI function calling API accepts as input, so it's clearly meant to work with the system OpenAI has set up for external function calling. Here's the list it returns:</p> <pre><code>{ &quot;skills&quot;: [ { &quot;name&quot;: &quot;Code search&quot;, &quot;slug&quot;: &quot;codesearch&quot;, &quot;description&quot;: &quot;Search file

Regardless, they don't seem to work, with the exception of 'ping', so it seems this is still a work in progress. Well, either that, or I just wasn't able to get it to work. I'm not quite sure which it is.</p> <p>To prevent abuse of these endpoints, I've left out some key information. The especially curious among you can open up Copilot Chat yourselves and try to see how it works, but it's a long process and a real pain in the ass. If you want to do it though, these endpoints all appear to still work! There's also some other hidden features you can unlock if you dig through the code, but for the sake of keeping this post to only the most interesting stuff I haven't included it here. I can expand on it later if people are interested.</p> <p>I'm happy to answer any questions about this in the comments, but I hope we can stick to facts instead of the rampant speculation that all the big AI subs are always caught up in. :)</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/WithoutReason1729"> /u/WithoutReason1729 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ht56t/new_leaks_about_upcoming_developments_with_openai/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17ht56t/new_leaks_about_upcoming_developments_with_openai/">[comments]</a></span>

Your reputation is a valuable asset. Be consistent with your image and messaging.</li> </ol> <p>&#x200b;</p> <ol> <li>**Innovation:** &quot;You've been patient, never complacent.&quot; - Keep innovating and improving your products or services. A commitment to constant improvement can set you apart from competitors.</li> </ol> <p>&#x200b;</p> <ol> <li>**Long-Term Vision:** &quot;I'd rather die enormous than live dormant.&quot; - Think long-term. Set ambitious goals for your business and work persistently toward them.
