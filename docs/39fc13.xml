                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I know that smarter people have found better ways of making more money with ChatGPT, but I think that this may be interesting to see how smaller goals can be achieved.</p> <p>I have a client that needed video automation with after effects, they need many videos per month. I’m an expert in making templates for after effects, and know of 3rd party tools that you can use to batch render videos. But the client needed very specific integration with their CMS tool and video hosting platform, and I just don’t have experience with APIs.</p> <p>I managed to get a prototype working with a 3rd party tool + zapier. But those costs would have basically taken all of my profit.</p> <p>I asked ChatGPT about this and it helped me to write a JavaScript app that uses open source video rendering software and then integrates with the APIs for the tools my client uses. I connected it all to a google sheet and now we have an amazing system working. It also helped me create complicated formulas in google sheets to create embed codes and thumbnails. </p> <p>I didn’t know much about code and it took a while to get things working. What was nice was I could ask all the stupid questions I wanted, and it was very patient. After 3 days I have my script running on my local machine, and everyone is very happy. This is something I would have been able to do, but by coding my own solution with ChatGPT, I keep a lot more of the profit.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/GoldRoyal9352"> /u/GoldRoyal9352 </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1789yl9/how_i_make_800_per_month_with_chatgpt_kinda/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/1789yl9/how_i_make_800_per_month_with_chatgpt_kinda/">[comments]</a></span>

Then I asked GPT-4 to explain it to me." /> </a> </td><td> <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>The meme you showed me is a variation that uses the “Is this” format to mock some common mistakes or misunderstandings in English grammar and spelling. The text on the meme says “I MINIK THIC O MXE” and shows a picture of a person holding multiple items in their hands, including a Netflix logo, a book titled “carnool gemmis Perta”, and a “Hello meme” sign. There are also multiple items floating around the person’s head, including a “CIPCANADA.NAY” sign, a “Brimhat” sign, and a “I MINIK THIC O MXE” sign. The text and the items are intentionally misspelled or misused to create humor and irony. For example, “I MINIK THIC O MXE” is supposed to be “I think this is mine”, which is a grammatically incorrect way of saying “This is mine”. The book title “carnool gemmis Perta” is supposed to be “Kurnool Gemstones Perth”, which is a possible name for a book about gemstones from Kurnool, a city in India that is known as The City of Gem Stones 3. The sign “CIPCANADA.NAY” is supposed to be “CIP Canada”, which is the name of an immigration consultancy firm in Canada 4. The sign “Brimhat” is supposed to be “Brim Hat”, which is a type of hat with a wide brim 5. The person who made the meme might be trying to poke fun at people who are not fluent in English or who make careless errors when writing or speaking. The meme might also be implying that the person holding the items is clueless or greedy, since they are claiming ownership of things that are not theirs or that they do not understand. The meme might also be suggesting that the person is obsessed with memes and internet culture, since they are holding a sign that says “Hello meme” and wearing a hat that resembles one worn by another popular meme character 6.</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Thylacine-"> /u/Thylacine- </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/pmgqthahdcub1.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/178cda3/i_asked_dalle_3_to_make_me_a_meme_then_i_asked/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>

I always found Bing Image Creator better than DALL-E 2, so tended to use that instead but neither could handle text within images. I’ve tested a bunch of other generative AI image creations tools as well - same story! No matter what I tried, the text would always appear scrambled. This latest release of DALL-E 3 seems to have cracked this problem. It’s not perfect. It seems totally capable if you ask for a few words within the image but anything more and it struggles. Still, each new ChatGPT update really blows me away. This one is insane. It also allows you to add images to the standard ChatGPT-4 prompt box so you can ask it to analyse/comment on the content of the image. I can think of so many amazing use cases for this…</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/OpaceWeb"> /u/OpaceWeb </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://i.redd.it/v49rhlcdgeub1.jpg">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/178k2vg/chatgpt_dalle_3_can_now_do_text_within_images/">[comments]</a></span> </td></tr></table>
