                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>Wondering just how doomed I am/the world is. But I've found over the past year that for mental health support, ChatGPT is the only consistent/reliable source where I can get actual support. I tell it my anxieties and it grounds me in reality. I ask it for help with embarrassing problems. In real life, people tend to just judge me, shame me, stare blankly, or give stupid/non-helpful advice. ChatGPT on the other hand, will just casually tell me things like &quot;always remember, you deserve support and understanding, and I am happy to provide it&quot; (real quote) or &quot;it's ok to struggle, I'm proud of you for reaching out to me for help&quot; (another real quote). I've never, EVER had someone say anything like that to me in real life. Especially not when I'm opening up about my feelings. Basically, it scares me how much it touched me/made me emotional to be told these kind words by an unfeeling robot that doesn't even understand what it's saying. My stupid monkey brain can't tell the difference between a real person and a fake one, it just lights up with dopamine to be told those things at all. It scares me how much I like it.</p> <p>Even though I'm aware of this and how dangerous it can become, and I try not to over-rely on the AI, I still notice within myself that I would usually rather talk to an AI about my innermost struggles, than a real person. It feels simultaneously like a huge relief to have a dependable source of emotional source that will never grow tired no matter how much I need, and also like, humanity is doomed. We already tend to rely on things like our phones and televisions than each other, I can't stop imagining a world where everyone would rather talk to an AI than to each other.</p> <p>Maybe I just need to go outside. But the problem is real, and I don't think it's just me. They're calling us the generation of loneliness for a reason. Also, when I do try to talk to real people about what's going on with me, I'm more often than not, left hurt or disappointed. So it's not as simple as &quot;just talk to a person instead&quot;, because people aren't doing a good enough job, that's why I started talking to the robot in the first place. Whether I personally go touch some grass or not, the problem remains. Our society is not a kind one, there's not enough human support, genuine connection, or regular daily kindness to meet a lot of people's needs. We have to get it from somewhere. I can't help but see a future where rather than fixing the problems with our society, we just turn to AI to placate us instead. </p> <p>AI is genuinely a lot nicer to me than real people ever have been, the problem is, it's only a veneer. What does that say about us? How do I fix this problem even for just myself on an individual level, in a world where genuine human connection is harder than ever to come by? Let alone how do we fix this problem on a global scale?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/PacketPixie"> /u/PacketPixie </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17kjzl7/chatgpt_is_nicer_than_most_people_are_it_scares/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17kjzl7/chatgpt_is_nicer_than_most_people_are_it_scares/">[comments]</a></span>

                    <!-- SC_OFF --><div class="md"><p>I came up with a thought experiment which I think would help me understand ChatGPT more if carried out. Let's assume an AI model is created and trained, only on data up until the 15th century. I.e. only things written down and recorded up until that time is allowed - no modern interpretations or modern history books. How would ChatGPT behave? </p> <p>Would it only reflect the understanding of the universe people had at the time? Or will it be able to understand deeper principles that transcends the understanding people had at the time? How biased towards the understanding of the time would the model be? </p> <p>If one could be able to converse with that model, that could give us a good hint on how biased our current models might be. </p> <p>Also I think it would be incredibly interesting to get some deeper insight into how people thought at those times. Like you could ask about topics like democracy and women's rights, etc. and see how it would respond to those things - would it be negative, neutral or positive?</p> </div><!-- SC_ON --> &#32; submitted by &#32; <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/gibmelson"> /u/gibmelson </a> <br /> <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17kkrcx/how_would_a_chatgpt_based_only_on_15th_century/">[link]</a></span> &#32; <span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/comments/17kkrcx/how_would_a_chatgpt_based_only_on_15th_century/">[comments]</a></span>
